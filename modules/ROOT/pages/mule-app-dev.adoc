You create Mule applications to perform system integrations. Typically, the
application reads data from internal and external sources, processes and
transforms data to the required formats or structures, and writes that
output to the systems and servers where you store or use the transformed data.

Mule applications are configured to run in Mule runtime engine (Mule). A request
to a Mule application triggers Mule to encode the request and data in a Mule
event and to pass it to either single or multiple threads.

== Getting Started with Mule Application Development

To get started with Mule application development, you can follow the steps
in these tutorials:

* xref:mule-app-dev-hellomule.adoc[Create a "Hello World" Mule app]
+
Build a Mule application that interacts with a user in a simple HTTP
request-response flow.
+
* xref:mule-app-tutorial.adoc[Create a Mule app that uses the Database Connector and DataWeave]
+
Build a Mule application that retrieves data from a database and transforms it
to a new structure.

== Building Blocks of a Mule Application

Mule applications use connectors, modules, and components to read, write,
and process data.

* xref:connectors::index.adoc[Connectors and Modules]
+
Anypoint connectors
provide components, such as listeners, that interact with external API
endpoints and act on data in the Mule application. Modules, such as
the Validation, Java, Spring, and OAuth, provide modules that act on
data in a Mule application without providing a direct connection to an endpoint.
+
* xref:about-components.adoc[Core Components]
+
Core components support
flow control, error handling, logging, batch, and other programmatic
operations on data that flows through your application.

== DataWeave Language

DataWeave is the primary language used for formulating expressions in Mule.
Connectors, modules, and components support the use of DataWeave to access,
manipulate, and transform data structures and output formats, and to extract data
that is processed within the Mule application.

At runtime, Mule evaluates DataWeave expressions while executing a flow to:

* Extract data needed to process the current message
* Set or manipulate a value in the message

[[flows]]
== Mule Flows

Understanding basic flow architecture is key to understanding a Mule application.
Essentially, every Mule flow contains a series of Mule components that receive or
process messages:

.Simple Flow in Design Center

At the simplest level, flows are sequences of processors. A message
that enters a flow can pass through a variety of processors. In a typical
flow, a Mule application receives a message through a source (such as an
HTTP Listener component), transforms that message into a new format, and processes
any business logic before writing the processed message to an external
system in a format that the system can read.

To separate processing into more manageable units, Mule applications often contain
multiple, interrelated flows instead of just a single flow. One flow can call
another flow as a direct reference.

For more information about this topic, see xref:about-flows.adoc[Flows and Subflows] and
xref:mule-components.adoc[Mule Components].

=== Sources

A source component (or trigger) is the first component in a flow. It
receives a triggering event, creates a corresponding Mule event,
and forwards that event for processing by the next component in the flow.

External clients can trigger processing in a Mule flow through several
communication protocols and methods, such as JMS, HTTP, FTP, JDBC, or File.
Mule translates these communication protocols and methods into a standard
message format, which passes through the flow's processors.

Sources in Mule can connect to specific external sources, either through
a standard protocol or a third-party API. It is also possible to set a Scheduler
component. Some schedulers can poll for specific changes to external resources,
such as new files or table rows in an external resource. Examples of listeners
and connector operations that can trigger a flow include:

* HTTP, JMS, and VM listeners in their associated connectors
* On Table Row operation in the Database connector
* On New or Updated File operation in the File and FTP connectors
* Scheduler

Note that you can also create your own source using the
xref:mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK].

=== Processors

After a flow is triggered through the source component, subsequent components process
the data as it travels through the flow. By default, each processor
that receives a Mule event returns a new Mule message, typically with a set
of attributes and the message payload that the processor returns. The processor
forwards the new message as output to the next processor in the flow.

Processors available to Mule applications include:

* Components from modules and connectors
+
Examples include operations that read
from and write to an external resource and that validate data in the Mule application.
Some operations can make client requests to external resources and services
(including external databases and systems, such as Salesforce, Workday,
ServiceNow, and many others) and to other Mule applications. Others can run your
custom code, support OAuth configurations, and manage communication through
asynchronous queues, for example. Many other operations are
available.
+
* Core components
+
Core components can route data, perform data transformations, handle errors
that might occur when processing the event, and perform other tasks in a
Mule application.
+
Transformers (such as the Transform Message, Set Variable, and others) are
key to exchanging data between nodes. Transformers enable Mule to convert
message data in the Mule event to a format that another application or service can
read.
+
Mule also enables content enrichment of messages (through
xref:target-variables.adoc[Target Variables]) so that you can retrieve
additional data and attach it to the message.

Note that you can also create your own event processors using the
xref:mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK].

== Security

You can provide security to your Mule applications by encrypting properties, configuring
secure communications over TLS, setting up authentication over OAuth 2.0, and
providing cryptographic and other capabilities, such as FIPS compliance.

* xref:securing.adoc[Security]

== Development Environments

You can develop a Mule application using
xref:studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio] (an Eclipse-based IDE), or, if you are an advanced developer, in your own IDE.

For example, in Studio, you build and design a Mule application in a project
that contains one or more XML-based files. A Mule project supports all the
dependencies required for development. The
xref:studio::index.adoc#package-explorer[Package Explorer] view in Studio
provides access to the project folders and files that make up a Mule project.
Studio provides a design-time environment in which you can also build, run, and test
your Mule application.

[[version]]
== Mule Versioning

The Mule version you use determines what your Mule application, domain, or policy can
do and what features and products are compatible with Mule.  For example,
xref:about-components.adoc[Core components], which process the Mule event
as it travels through flows in a Mule application, are part of a Core module that is
bundled with and shares the same version as Mule.
xref:connectors::index.adoc[Modules, connectors], the DataWeave language, and
several MuleSoft products have their own versioning system but are
compatible with specific versions of Mule. For example, DataWeave 2.0 and
Studio 7.x are compatible Mule 4.x runtime engines, while DataWeave 1.0 and
Studio 6.x are compatible with Mule 3.x runtime engines. You need to make sure the
connector or module you use in a Mule application is compatible with your Mule version.
