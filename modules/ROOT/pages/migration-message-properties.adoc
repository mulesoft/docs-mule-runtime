// Contacts/SMEs: Ana Felissati, Pablo La Greca

In Mule runtime engine (Mule) 3, there are several property scopes have been removed in Mule 4.

== Invocation Properties

Invocation properties are now called `variables` in Mule 4. Their behavior is exactly the same as in Mule 3.

== Inbound Properties, Outbound Properties, and Inbound and Outbound Attachments

These scopes do not exist in Mule 4. See xref:intro-mule-message.adoc[Intro Mule Message] for more information about migration.
