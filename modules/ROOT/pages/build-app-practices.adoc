As you build your applications, consider the following best practices for creating a clean, organized, and sustainable project. These practices include guidelines on using Anypoint Studio, avoiding certain app-building issues, and specific settings for using Mule runtime engine (Mule) components and connectors.

== Anypoint Studio Best Practices
If you use Anypoint Studio to build Mule apps, consider the following practices:

* Update to the latest version of Anypoint Studio.
* Use the recommended Java version (OpenJDK) for the specific Studio version.
* Include the Mule Maven plugin for automated deployment (executed by CI/CD processes).

=== Define a Project Structure
To help maintain a clean, structured, and readable project in Anypoint Studio, consider the following recommendations:

* Create a separate XML file for global elements, for example, configuration elements.
* Create a separate XML file for each use case or resource implementation.
* Create separate XML files for common structures or logic.
* Create different packages for resources such as DataWeave, WSDLs, examples, and so on.

==== Add Indentation and Formatting

As you build your app project in Anypoint Studio, consider the following points:

* Add indentation and format to all your XML files (Mule XMLs, `pom.xml`, `log4j2.xml`, and so on) before committing to the source code repository.
* Define a line width in your Anypoint Studio XML editor preferences, for example `140.d`.
* Define a naming convention.

==== Manage Properties per Environment

To avoid creating a separate set of variables for each environment, Mule 4 contains a built-in mechanism that enables you to set default values, which you manage by using Anypoint Runtime Manager. For details, see xref:intro-configuration.adoc[Introduction to Mule 4: Configuring Mule Apps] and xref:configuring-properties.adoc[Configuring Properties].

== App-Building Best Practice

As you build your Mule app, avoid packaging the configuration files for all the environments inside the application. Instead, use a `.yaml` file to provide default properties, and use Anypoint Runtime Manager to override each of these properties at deployment time.

== Components and Connectors Best Practices

When building your apps using Mule components and connectors, consider the following recommendations.

=== APIkit

When using APIkit, consider these practices:

* Use APIkit features to generate flows automatically using your API specification.
* Use APIkit Exception Strategy to catch connector-related exceptions.

=== DataWeave

When using DataWeave for building your app, consider these recommendations:

* Use inline scripts during the development phase.
* To have a clean XML and reusable scripts, pass the inline scripts to an external file.

=== Flows
When creating flows for your app, consider the following practices:

* Have a clear flow diagram showing the steps of the use case.
* Use a Flow Reference to separate and reuse common logic.

=== File Connector

If you use Anypoint Connector for File (File Connector) and share part of the path on numerous reads or any other file operations, extract the base path into a file configuration to reuse it:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:config name="File_Config" >
   <file:connection workingDir="/Example/path" />
</file:config>

<flow>
   <file:read config-ref="File_Config" path="manual.txt" />
   <file:read config-ref="File_Config" path="readme.txt" />
</flow>
----

=== HTTP and HTTPS
For HTTP and HTTPS, use the following placeholders, depending on the deployment model:

* `${http.port}` +
* `${https.port}` +
When deploying to CloudHub or Hybrid using HTTP (port=8081) or HTTPS (port=8082)

* `${http.private.port}` +
* `${https.private.port}` +
When deploying to CloudHub using HTTP (port=8091) or HTTPS (port=8092) and using a Dedicated Load Balancer

=== Apache Kafka Connector

If you use Anypoint Connector for Apache Kafka (Apache Kafka Connector) perform the following actions:

* Use the `.properties` file to add bootstrap server configuration.
* Add property placeholders, either in a `.yaml` or a `.properties` file, and use the file in the configuration:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
config.bootstrapServers={your Kafka Server address}
config.consumerPropertiesFile=consumer.properties
config.producerPropertiesFile=producer.properties
# Consumer specific information
consumer.topic=one-replica
consumer.topic.partitions=1
----

* Apache Kafka Connector provides various settings for producer and consumer properties, add your own settings in `consumer.properties` and `producer.properties` under `src/main/resource`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<configuration-properties file="mule-app.properties"/>
----
