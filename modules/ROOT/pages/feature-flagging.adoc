= Feature Flagging Mechanism
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

Mule runtime engine incorporates a feature flagging mechanism that enables Mule applications to change the behavior of the Mule instance depending on the required minimum Mule version. This feature ensures backward compatibility because it allows Mule applications to continue working on later Mule runtime versions, while new Mule applications can benefit from the latest bug fixes implemented in the Mule instance.

The feature flagging mechanism is automatic. For each Mule application deployed to a Mule instance, Mule determines which features are enabled or disabled based on the application’s minimum Mule version configured in the application descriptor file (`mule-artifact.json`) of the Mule app.

By default, Mule runtime engine disables any new features or bug fixes that are not backward compatible with Mule applications running in earlier Mule versions. However, it is possible to manage the feature flags configured for each Mule application or all applications running in the same Mule instance.

== Configure Feature Flags for a Mule Application

To configure feature flags for a Mule application, change the `minMuleVersion` value in the `mule-artifact.json` file of your app. This configuration instructs the Mule instance to run this application implementing all features and bug fixes that were released to that particular version and disabling features and bug fixes that are active by default in later Mule versions.

For example, you can run a Mule application in Mule 4.4.0 instructing the Mule instance to apply only the features that do not change core functionality up to Mule 4.1.0:

.Example `mule-artifact.json` file
----
{
  "minMuleVersion": "4.1.0"
}
----

== Configure Feature Flags for the Mule Instance

An alternative way to configure feature flags is by using system properties. In this case, you can enable or disable each one of the available feature flags. However, configuring feature flags through system properties applies the changes at the Mule instance level, so all applications deployed to this Mule instance behave according to the configured feature flags.

Note that this configuration is compatible with on-premise deployments only because you cannot configure system properties in other deployment targets.

For example, you can configure a Mule 4.3.0 instance to enable and disable specific features for all applications running on this instance:

.Example `wrapper.conf` file
----
…
wrapper.java.additional.999=-DHONOUR_RESERVED_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY=true
wrapper.java.additional.1000=-DCOMPUTE_CONNECTION_ERRORS_IN_STATS_PROPERTY=false
----

== Feature Flags Reference

The following table shows the available feature flags, a description of their functionality, the Mule version in which the flag became available, the earlier minor version releases that enable the flag by default, and the issue ID in which the change was implemented:

<.^|`mule.suppress.mule.exceptions`
|When enabled, error suppression occurs. This feature prevents component such as the Web Service Consumer connector and the Until Successful scope from reporting errors outside their namespaces.

Example of an error log extract for a connectivity error at the Web Service Consumer (HTTP:CONNECTIVITY is being suppressed):

    Error type : WSC:INVALID_WSDL
    Caused by  : HTTP:CONNECTIVITY

Suppressed errors are treated as underlying causes that can also be matched by On Error handlers.
