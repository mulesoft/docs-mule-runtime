= Mule Upgrade Tool

include::release-notes::partial$mule-upgrade-tool/mule-upgrade-tool-1.1.0.adoc[tag=intro]

If the Runtime Manager agent is installed in your current Mule instance, the upgrade tool also updates the agent version as part of the upgrade process.

The Mule upgrade tool supports upgrading clustered Mule instances by manually upgrading each node using the tool. For additional information on how to proceed with the upgrade, see <<upgrade_clustered_mule_instances>>. Though highly recommended, using the tool is not strictly necessary to upgrade your current Mule instance. For a completely manual upgrade, see xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/updating-mule-4-versions.adoc#mulerunvers[Upgrading an On-Premises Mule Instance Managed Through Runtime Manager].

== Before You Begin

Before starting your upgrade, ensure that you have:

include::partial$upgrade-tool.adoc[tag=BeforeYouBegin]

== Upgrade or Update Mule

include::partial$upgrade-tool.adoc[tag=UpgradeOrUpdateMule]

== Roll Back an Upgrade or Update

include::partial$upgrade-tool.adoc[tag=RollBackUpgradeOrUpdate]

== Solving File Conflicts

The Mule upgrade tool compares configuration files from the _current_ Mule distribution and the _new_ distribution to detect changes and prevent losing them. When the Mule upgrade tool detects changes in the _new_ Mule distribution configuration files, it tries to resolve conflicts automatically and continue with the upgrade. If conflicts cannot be resolved automatically, the tool performs the following actions:

* Fails the execution of the `upgrade` subcommand, showing an error message.
* Logs the names of the Mule configuration files with conflicts into the log output.
* Copies the configuration files with conflicts from the `${MULE_HOME}/conf` directory of the current Mule distribution to `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/to_review`.
* Copies the original content of the configuration files from the _new_ Mule distribution to the `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-configs-conflicts/new-${MULE_HOME_NEW_FOLDER_NAME}` folder.

If the upgrade process fails due to conflicts with the configuration files, follow the next steps to resolve the conflicts and continue the upgrade process.

[[steps-to-solve-conflicts]]
=== Steps to Solve Conflicts with Mule Configuration Files

Follow these steps to resolve conflicts during an upgrade:

. Inside the `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/to_review/` folder of the current Mule distribution that you are upgrading, locate one of the files that has a conflict.
. Use any file comparison or `diff` tool to compare the contents of the files in the following paths:
** `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/to_review/fileWithConflicts.conf`
** `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-configs-files/new-${MULE_HOME_NEW_FOLDER_NAME}/fileWithConflicts.conf`
. After reviewing the differences, merge or discard the changes:
* If you decide to merge the changes, modify the previous configuration file `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/to_review/fileWithConflicts.conf` adding the desired changes from the new configuration file `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/new-${MULE_HOME_NEW_FOLDER_NAME}/fileWithConflicts.conf`. Then, copy the merged file to the `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/ready` folder.
* If you decide to discard the changes maintaining your previous configuration, move the previous configuration file `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/to_review/fileWithConflicts.conf` to the `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/ready` folder.
+
Note that discarding the changes sometimes lead to using deprecated settings in the updated Mule distribution.
. Repeat steps 1 to 3 for each configuration file in the `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/to_review` folder.
. Retry running the `upgrade` subcommand.
+
When the upgrade finishes successfully, the tool deletes the `${MULE_HOME}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts` folder to have a clean environment for future upgrades.

=== Unattended Upgrades or Updates

You can perform an unattended upgrade or update by resolving the conflicts in a different environment before running the upgrade in the target environment. This procedure works only if the _current_ and _new_ Mule distributions that you configure in the secondary environment match the versions of the _current_ and _new_ Mule distributions, respectively, that you have in the main environment:

. In an environment where user interaction is possible, review and resolve all the conflicts as explained in <<steps-to-solve-conflicts>>.
. In the target environment, copy the files from `${MULE_HOME_WITH_USER_INTERACTION}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/ready/` to `${MULE_HOME_WITHOUT_USER_INTERACTION}/upgrade-tool/mule-config-conflicts/ready/`.
. Run the `upgrade` subcommand in the target environment.

== Configure Logging for the Mule Upgrade Tool

You can enable debug logging to add detailed information about each operation, change the folder where the tool stores the logs, and also use a customized log configuration file for the Mule upgrade tool.

=== Specify a Custom Log4j File

By default, the Mule upgrade tool uses the `log4j2-upgrade-tool.xml` file that is located in the `$MULE_HOME/tools/upgrade-tool` folder.

To use a custom Log4j file, use the `-l` parameter and specify the file name of the custom Log4j configuration file to use, for example:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
$MULE_HOME/tools/upgrade-tool -l myLog4j2File.xml upgrade
----

=== Enable DEBUG Level Logs

To enable debug logging:

. Open the Log4j file you are using with the tool.
. Replace the `level` property value `INFO` with `DEBUG`, in the following line of the Log4j file:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Logger level="INFO" name="com.mulesoft.runtime.upgrade.tool.service" additivity="false">
----

=== Customize the Logs Output

By default, the Mule upgrade tool stores logs in the `./mule-runtime-upgrade-tool-logs directory`.

To change the file name, output path, and log pattern:

. Open the Log4j file you are using with the tool.
. Specify the desired values for the `fileName` and `filePattern` properties:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<RollingFile name="RollingFile"
  fileName="./mule-runtime-upgrade-tool-logs/mule-runtime-upgrade-tool-logs.log"
  filePattern="./mule-runtime-upgrade-tool-logs/$${date:yyyy-MM}/mule-runtime-upgrade-tool-logs-%d{-dd-MMMM-yyyy}-%i.log.gz" >
----

No space left on device
----

==== Cause

This error indicates that there is no available disk space to run the upgrade.

==== Solution

The tool requires at least 2 GB of space available in the file system in which the Mule instance is running. Ensure that your system has
enough disk space available and that any other requirements are met.

On Linux environments, use the `df` command to check available disk space:


----
$ df -h /opt
Filesystem              Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vg-opt      419G  205G  193G  52% /opt

ERROR: Version of new Mule distribution 4.4.0-20211104 should be newer than old Mule distribution: 4.4.0-20211104
----

==== Cause

This error occurs when the upgrade command specifies a new Mule distribution that is in the same version as the current Mule instance.

==== Solution

Verify that the downloaded Mule distribution is in a later version than your current Mule instance. If you continue to receive this error message during the upgrade, it means that the current Mule instance is already updated or running the latest available version.

=== Missing reading permissions

[...]
----

==== Cause

Read permissions in the new Mule distribution are required but not set for the user who is performing the upgrade, so that user cannot read the file referenced in the stack trace.

==== Solution

Obtain read permission for files that the upgrade identifies as unreadable. Contact your system administrator for assistance, if necessary.

=== Missing writing permissions

----

==== Cause

The Mule upgrade tool requires both the current Mule instance and the new Mule instance (`/new-${MULE_HOME_NEW_FOLDER_NAME}`) to be running version 4.1.5 or later.

==== Solution

Perform a manual upgrade to ensure that the current and new Mule instances are in version 4.1.5 or later before attempting to upgrade using the Mule upgrade tool.

[[upgrade_clustered_mule_instances]]
== Upgrading Clustered Mule Instances

To upgrade clustered Mule instances, use the Mule upgrade tool to automate the upgrade process of your local Mule instances by manually upgrading each node.

=== Before You Begin

Before starting your upgrade, ensure that you have:

* The new Mule runtime distribution (target version) and the Mule upgrade tool copied to each node that you are upgrading, to reduce downtime.
+
include::partial$upgrade-tool.adoc[tag=BeforeYouBegin]

=== Upgrade or Update Mule

include::partial$upgrade-tool.adoc[tag=UpgradeOrUpdateMule]

Note that every node must be upgraded or updated to the same Mule runtime version to work.

=== Roll Back an Upgrade or Update

include::partial$upgrade-tool.adoc[tag=RollBackUpgradeOrUpdate]

Note that every node must be rolled back to the same Mule runtime version to work.
