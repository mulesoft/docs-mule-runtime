= Duplicating Data Structures in Map Format

*_Version 3.3.1 only_*

Use DataMapper to easily map data from an input file into a map format. (In DataMapper's configuration, Map format is called `Maps/List of Maps`.) Rather than creating separate, identical input and output files between which you wish to map data, you can simply duplicate the content of your input file to use in the *output pane*.

After duplicating the data, you can edit — add, remove or rename fields — then map data between input and output fields.

[TIP]
This document assumes the reader is familiar with the DataMapper Transformer. Consult the https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/6/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[DataMapper Transformer Reference] document for details.

== JSON to Map Format

The following example adds a new DataMapper transformer to a flow, then configures it to generate a duplicate of a JSON input file in the output pane.

[TIP]
====
*_Version 3.3.1 only_*

You can edit data structure definitions (i.e. fields) in an _existing_ DataMapper transformer within the *Input* and *Output* panes of its `DataMapper View`. Consult xref:editing-metadata.adoc[Editing Metadata] for details.

=== Creating the Input JSON File

. Open a new file in a text editor, then paste into it the following contents:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
{
  "type": "members",
  "id": "id0",
  "contacts": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "lastname": ""
    },
    {
      "name": "",
      "lastname": ""
    },
  ],
  "emergencyContacts": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "lastname": ""
    },
  ]
}
----

. Save the file to a convenient location under a useful descriptive name such as `Input.json`. This file serves as the input JSON file for the example.

=== Adding DataMapper with a Duplicate Data Structure

The following procedure offers abbreviated steps for adding a DataMapper to a flow. For detailed instructions, consult the https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/6/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[*DataMapper Transformer Reference*] document.

. From the *Transformers* group in the *Palette*, drag a *DataMapper* building block to any location in your flow, except to the left of the flow's message source).
. Double-click the DataMapper to open its configuration wizard.
. In the *Name* input box within the *Data Mapping Flow* pane, type a useful, descriptive name for your DataMapper, then click *Next*.
. In the *Input* section of the the *Select Input and Output Type* pane, use the drop-down menu next to the *Type* field to select *JSON*.
. Click the ellipsis symbol (*...*) next to the *Json sample* field.
. Use the file browser to select the JSON file you created.
. In the *Output* section, use the drop-down menu next to the *Type* field to select `*Maps / List of Maps*`.
. Click *Generate default* under the *Name* field. DataMapper duplicates the data in the JSON input file in map format and changes the value of the *Name* field from `*outputMetadata*` to `*object*` (see image below).

. Click *Edit Fields* to open the *Edit Map Fields* panel in preparation for editing the map-format output fields.
+

=== Adding a Field to the Map Format Output

. In the *Edit Map Fields* panel, right-click `*contacts*` in the *Output* pane.
. Select *Add Field* to create a new field labeled `*field1*` (see below, left).
. Click `*field1*` (see below, right) to edit the name of the field, then press *Enter*.

==== Alternative Method

. Click `*contacts*` to select the element.
. Click the image:add.png[(plus)] icon in the upper-left corner of the *Edit Map Fields* panel to create a new field labeled `*field1*`.
. Click `*field1*` to edit the name of the field, then press *Enter*.

=== Renaming a Field in the Map Format Output

. To rename a field, click the field name.
. Edit the field's name, then press *Enter*.

=== Modifying Field Type in the Map Format Output

. To modify the type of a field, click the field's type in the *Type* column.
. Use the drop-down menu to select a new field type.

. Click *OK* to save your changes and close the *Edit Map Fields* panel.

=== Deleting a Field in the Map Format Output

Use one of the following three methods to delete a field.

* Click to select the field, then press *Delete* (not *Backspace*).
* Right-click the field name, then select *Remove* from the drop-down menu.
* Click to select the field, then press the red "X" icon in the upper-left corner of the *Edit Map Fields* panel.
