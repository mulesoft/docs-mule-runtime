= For Each Scope

:page-aliases: for-each-scope-xml-reference.adoc

The For Each scope splits a payload into elements and processes them one by one through the components that you place in the scope.
It is similar to a `for-each`/`for` loop code block in most programming languages and can process any collection, including lists and arrays.
The collection can be any supported content type, such as `application/json`, `application/java`, or `application/xml`.

TODO? Splitter not in Studio 7 as of GA. Not clear when it will be in.
== Differences With a Splitter

The For Each scope performs a similar task to using a Splitter and then an Aggregator. The main difference is that the For Each scope outputs a collection just like the one it receives, the Aggregator outputs a message where the payload is a list of mule messages (each with its own payload and attributes).
////
General considerations about the For Each scope:

* By default, For Each tries to split the payload. If the payload is a simple Java collection, the For Each scope can split it without any configuration. The payload inside the For Each scope is each of the split elements. Attributes within the original message are ignored because they are related to the entire message.
* For Each does not modify the current payload. The output payload is the same as the input.
* For non-Java collections, such as XML or JSON, use a DataWeave expression to split data. Use the *Collection* field for this purpose.
+
In the following example, the *Collection* field in For Each is set to iterate over an array stored in `payload.topics`:
+
image::component-foreach-example.png[For Each Component]

The For Each scope stores each item of the collection in `payload` during each iteration.
////
Note that if the input contains information outside the collection you tell it to split, this information is lost.
////

You can also split an array into batches to enable quicker processing. Each batch is treated as a separate Mule message. For example, if a collection has 200 elements and you set *Batch Size* to `50`, the For Each scope iteratively processes 4 batches of 50 elements, each as a separate Mule message.

== Example XML

This is an example XML based on the For Each scope configuration detailed above:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
...
  <foreach doc:name="For Each" collection="#[payload.topics]" batchSize="1" rootMessageVariableName="rootMessage" counterVariableName="counter">
      <file:write ... >
      <!--Any other module that you want to include in the For Each scope -->
  </foreach>
...
----

== Variable Propagation

Every execution of the For Each scope starts with the variables and values
from the previous execution of the block. New variables or modifications
to existing variables that take place when processing one element are visible
during the processing of another element. These changes to variables continue
to be available outside the For Each scope.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-variable variableName="var1" value="var1"/>
<set-variable variableName="var2" value="var2"/>
<foreach collection="#[['apple', 'banana', 'orange']]">
    <choice>
        <when expression="#[payload == 'apple']">
            <set-variable variableName="var2" value="newValue"/>
            <set-variable variableName="var3" value="appleVal"/>
        </when>
        <when expression="#[payload == 'banana']">
            <set-variable variableName="var3" value="#[vars.var3 ++ ' bananaVal']"/>
            <!-- var3 will now have value 'appleVal bananaVal'-->
        </when>
        <otherwise>
            <set-variable variableName="var3" value="otherVal"/>
            <set-variable variableName="var4" value="val4"/>
        </otherwise>
    </choice>
</foreach>
----

After aggregation, the variables are:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{var1: "var1", var2: "newValue", var3: "otherVal", var4: "val4"}
----

== Error Handling

If one of the elements in a collection throws an exception, the For Each scope stops processing that collection and invokes the error handler.

== Example Projects

There are several example projects in Anypoint Exchange that you can open in Anypoint Studio to learn more about how to use the For Each scope:

* _Authenticating Salesforce using OAuth2_
* _Import contacts into Microsoft Dynamics CRM_
* _Importing a CSV file into mongoDB_
* _Importing an Email Attachment using the IMAP Connector_
* _Importing Email Attachments using the POP3 Connector_
* _Querying a Database and Attaching Results to an Email_

To download and open an example project while you are in Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the upper-left corner. Then, in the window that opens, log into Anypoint Exchange and search on the name of the project.

== XML Reference

For Each scopes open and close with a `<foreach>` tag. Components that are affected by this scope are defined as child elements of the `<foreach>` tag.

=== Configurable Variables

[%header,cols="35,20,45"]
|===
|Variable | Default | Description
| `collection`
| `payload`
| An expression that returns a Java collection, object array, map, or DOM
 nodes.

| `counterVariableName`
| `counter`
| Name of the variable that stores the number of messages over which it iterates.

| `batchSize`
| `1`
| Partitions the collection into sub-collections of the specified
 size. For example, if a collection has 200 elements and you set the batch size to 50, it processes 4 batches of 50 elements each.

| `rootMessageVariableName`
| `rootMessage`
| Name of the variable that stores the parent message. The parent is the complete, non-split message.
|===


////
=== Iterate a JSON Array

[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/for-each-scope-concept_1.xml[]
----

In this case, the payload contains a JSON array. For Each iterates over the payload because the `collection` attribute has not been defined. The payload within For Each is each of the users in the JSON array.

=== Iterate over a Java Map that is Placed in a Variable

[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/for-each-scope-concept_2.xml[]
----

The example uses the `ee:transform` to set a variable named `users` with a Java map that is created with DataWeave. Then it uses a built-in DataWeave function to get the entries of a map as a collection in order to iterate over it.

=== Split a Collection into Batches

[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/for-each-scope-concept_3.xml[]
----

The `batchSize` attribute creates sub-arrays of two elements. So inside `foreach`, the payload will have an array of two elements.

=== Aggregate the Process of Each Element into a Variable

[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/for-each-scope-concept_4.xml[]
----

Within the For Each, the example creates an `aggregation` variable that concatenates the name in reverse. Then that variable can be accessed outside the For Each scope.

== Persisting Data

In case the message inside the For Each scope is persisted, not only the item in the collection is serialized but also all the variables associated with it. The rootMessage variable, associated with the message, contains a reference to the complete, unsplit collection. Therefore, serialization/deserialization of the rootMessage variable could impact memory consumption considerably when this collection is large enough.

To avoid this issue you must first remove the rootMessage variable from the message before persisting it.
