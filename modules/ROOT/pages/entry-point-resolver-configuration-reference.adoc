This page provides details on the elements you configure for entry point resolvers and entry point resolver sets.

== Entry Point Resolver Sets

An extensible set of entry point resolvers. These determine how a message is passed to a component in Java. Each entry point resolver is tried in turn until one succeeds in delivering the message to the component. This element can be set on the model or component; the model value provides a default that individual component values can override.

|Name |Cardinality |Description
|abstract-entry-point-resolver |0..* |A placeholder for an entry point resolver element. Entry point resolvers define how payloads are delivered to Java code by choosing the method to call.
|===

=== Legacy entry point resolver set

An extensible set of entry point resolvers (which determine how a message is passed to a component in Java) that already contains resolvers to implement the standard logic. This is already provided by default and is only needed explicitly if it will be extended with other entry point resolvers. This element can be set on the model or component; the model value provides a default that individual component values can override.

=== Callable entry point resolver

An entry point resolver for components that implement the Callable interface. This passes a MuleEventContext to the component. This element can be set on the model or component; the model value provides a default that individual component values can override. This element can also be used directly or as part of a set of resolvers; the resolvers in a set are used in turn until one is successful.

=== Custom entry point resolver

A custom entry point resolver. This allows user-supplied code to determine how a message is passed to a component in Java. This element can be set on the model or component; the model value provides a default that individual component values can override. This element can also be used directly or as part of a set of resolvers; the resolvers in a set are used in turn until one is successful.

.Attributes of <custom-entry-point-resolver...>

|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description

|spring:property |0..* |Spring-style property element for custom configuration.

=== Property entry point resolver

Uses a message property to select the component method to be called. This element can be set on the model or component; the model value provides a default that individual component values can override. This element can also be used directly or as part of a set of resolvers; the resolvers in a set are used in turn until one is successful.

.Attributes of <property-entry-point-resolver...>
[%header%autowidth,width=80%]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|acceptVoidMethods |boolean |no |  |Whether the resolver should call void methods. By default, void methods are not considered as possible candidates for message delivery.
|property |name (no spaces) |no |  |The name of the message property used to select a method on the component.

=== Method entry point resolver

Delivers the message to a named method. This element can be set on the model or component; the model value provides a default that individual component values can override. This element can also be used directly or as part of a set of resolvers; the resolvers in a set are used in turn until one is successful.

|Name |Cardinality |Description
|include-entry-point |1..* |A possible method for delivery.

=== Reflection entry point resolver

Generates a list of candidate methods from the component via reflections. This element can be set on the model or component; the model value provides a default that individual component values can override. This element can also be used directly or as part of a set of resolvers; the resolvers in a set are used in turn until one is successful.

.Attributes of <reflection-entry-point-resolver...>
[%header%autowidth,width=80%]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|acceptVoidMethods |boolean |no |  |Whether the resolver should call void methods. By default, void methods are not considered as possible candidates for message delivery.

[%header%autowidth,width=70%]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|exclude-object-methods |0..1 |If specified, methods in the Java Object interface are not included in the list of possible methods that can receive the message.
|exclude-entry-point |0..* |Explicitly excludes a named method from receiving the message.
|===

=== Array entry point resolver

Delivers the message to a method that takes a single array as argument. This element can be set on the model or component; the model value provides a default that individual component values can override. This element can also be used directly or as part of a set of resolvers; the resolvers in a set are used in turn until one is successful.

.Attributes of <array-entry-point-resolver...>

|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|acceptVoidMethods |boolean |no |  |Whether the resolver should call void methods. By default, void methods are not considered as possible candidates for message delivery.
|enableDiscovery |boolean |no |true |If no method names are configured, attempts to discover the method to invoke based on the inbound message type.

|===

=== No arguments entry point resolver

Calls a method without arguments (the message is not passed to the component).
