====
*Note*: Acegi was replaced by Spring Security and deprecated. It was not supported past Mule 3.1. This configuration reference information is provided with the understanding that the if you are currently using the Mule Acegi module, upgrade from Acegi to Spring Security.

*Note*: The 3.1 XSD at http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/acegi/3.1/mule-acegi.xsd is the last version of this schema.

== Introduction

Acegi provides a number of authentication and authorization providers such as JAAS, LDAP, CAS (Yale Central Authentication service), and DAO. The Mule Acegi security manager implementation delegates to Acegi to provide authorization and authentication functions.

== Namespace and Syntax

XML namespace:

----
xmlns: acegi "http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/acegi"

XML schema location:

== Considerations

This module is documented for reference and to support existing implementations, but should not be used.

== Features

The Mule Acegi module enables you to hook your Mule implementation up to a number of standard security schemes. This Mule module was designed to allow you to hook into security providers, authentication and authorization services, and it is powerful enough to allow you to configure method-level authorization on components, meaning that users with different roles can only invoke certain service methods.

== Usage

The Mule Acegi module is deprecated.

=== Securing Service Components

To secure MethodInvocations, developers must add a properly configured `MethodSecurityInterceptor` into the application context. The beans requiring security are chained into the interceptor. This chaining is accomplished using Spring's `ProxyFactoryBean` or `BeanNameAutoProxyCreator`. Alternatively, Acegi security provides a `MethodDefinitionSourceAdvisor`, which you can use with Spring's `DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator` to automatically chain the security interceptor in front of any beans defined against the `MethodSecurityInterceptor`.

In addition to the `daoAuthenticationProvider` and `inMemoryDaoImpl` beans (see xref:configuring-security.adoc[Configuring Security]), the following beans must be configured:

* `MethodSecurityInterceptor`
* `AuthenticationManager`
* `AccessDecisionManager`
* `AutoProxyCreator`
* `RoleVoter`

=== The MethodSecurityInterceptor

The `MethodSecurityInterceptor` is configured with a reference to an:

* `AuthenticationManager`
* `AccessDecisionManager`

Following is a security interceptor for intercepting calls made to the methods of a component that has an interface `myComponentIfc ❶`, which defines two methods: `delete ❷` and `writeSomething ❸`. Roles are set on these methods as seen below in the property `objectDefinitionSource`.

          </value>
    </property>
  </bean>
</mule>
----

=== The AuthenticationManager

An AuthenticationManager is responsible for passing requests through a chain of `AuthenticationProvider` objects.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="authenticationManager" class='org.acegisecurity.providers.ProviderManager'>
      <property name= "providers">
            <list>
                 <ref local="daoAuthenticationProvider"/>
            </list>
      </property>
</bean>
----

=== The AccessDecisionManager

This bean specifies that a user can access the protected methods if they have any one of the roles specified in the `objectDefinitionSource`.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="accessDecisionManager" class='org.acegisecurity.vote.AffirmativeBased'>
      <property name="decisionVoters">
            <list>
                  <ref bean="roleVoter"/>
            </list>
      </property>
</bean>
----

=== The AutoProxyCreator

This bean defines a proxy for the protected bean. When an application asks Spring for `myComponent` bean, it gets this proxy instead.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="autoProxyCreator" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.BeanNameAutoProxyCreator">
    <property name="interceptorNames">
        <list>
            <value>myComponentSecurity</value>
        </list>
    </property>
    <property name="beanNames">
        <list>
            <value>myComponent</value>
        </list>
    </property>
    <property name='proxyTargetClass' value="true"/>
</bean>
----

When using `BeanNameAutoProxyCreator` to create the required proxy for security, the configuration must contain the property `proxyTargetClass` set to `true`. Otherwise, the method passed to `MethodSecurityInterceptor.invoke` is the proxy's caller, not the proxy's target.

=== The RoleVoter

The `RoleVoter` class will vote if any `ConfigAttribute` begins with `ROLE_`. The `RoleVoter` is case sensitive on comparisons as well as the `ROLE_` prefix.

* It will vote to grant access if there is a `GrantedAuthority`, which returns a String representation (via the `getAuthority()` method) exactly equal to one or more `ConfigAttributes` starting with `ROlE`.
* If there is no exact match of any `ConfigAttribute` starting with `ROLE_`, the `RoleVoter` will vote to deny access.
* If no `ConfigAttribute` begins with `ROLE_`, the voter will abstain.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="roleVoter" class="org.acegisecurity.vote.RoleVoter"/>
----

=== Setting Security Properties on the Security Provider

You can add any additional properties to the security provider in the `securityProperties` map. For example, this map can be used to change Acegi's default security strategy into one of the following:

* `MODE_THREADLOCAL`, which allows the authentication to be set on the current thread (this is the default strategy used by Acegi)
* `MODE_INHERITABLETHREADLOCAL`, which allows authentication to be inherited from the parent thread.
* `MORE_GLOBAL`, which allows the authentication to be set on all threads.

== Securing Components in Asynchronous Systems

Acegi security strategies are particularly useful with an asynchronous system, since we have to add a property on the security provider for the authentication to be set on more than one thread.

In this case, we would use `MODE_GLOBAL` as seen in the example below:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<acegi:security-manager>
    <acegi:delegate-security-provider name="memory-dao" delegate-ref="daoAuthenticationProvider">
        <acegi:security-property name="securityMode" value="MODE_GLOBAL"/>
    </acegi:delegate-security-provider>
</acegi:security-manager>
----
