This document walks through a few examples that introduce most of the basic implementations of Mule Expression Language (MEL). Each example includes a step-by-step-guide for creating the flow in Studio's Visual Editor or in XML. You can also jump straight to the [complete code for all six examples], which you can copy and manipulate further in your own applications.

== Assumptions

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule Expression Language's [basis syntax] and are comfortable building and running Mule applications using [Mule Studio] or XML.

If you aren't yet familiar with how to access information about the Mule messages that pass through your applications, consider following this [tutorial], which walks you through both examining your Mule message and its data structure and writing simple MEL expressions.

== Example 1 - Accessing Properties

This example creates a simple web service that takes an HTTP request that includes a `username` parameter and returns a greeting using that `username`.

In this example, use MEL to:

*Access inbound property
*Dynamically set the payload

=== Studio Visual Editor

. In a new flow, drag an HTTP endpoint and a Set Payload transformer.
+
[image]

. Open the HTTP endpoint's properties editor and give it the path `greet1`. In this way, the endpoint will be reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet1`.

. Open the Set Payload's properties editor and set the value field with the following MEL expression:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
Hello #[message.inboundProperties.username]
----
+
This expression will capture the inbound property `username`, which is passed as a query string parameter when calling the service.

. Save and run the project.

. Through a web browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet1?username=yourName`. The response prints the words `Hello yourName` in your browser.
+
[TIP]
====
This method of accessing query string parameters does not escape URL encoded characters (such as spaces, which would be read as `%20`). If you want to access the escaped values of these parameters, you can do it through a special inbound property provided by Mule named `http.query.params` which contains a map, where keys are property names and values are escaped property values.

In this example, you can get a user name with escaped characters through this expression:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Hello #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username]
----
====

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. In a new flow, add an `http:inbound-endpoint` and configure it with path `greet1`.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost" port="8081" path="greet1" doc:name="HTTP"/>
----
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*exchange-pattern* |`request-response`
|*host* |`localhost`
|*port* |`8081`
|*path* |`greet1`
|*doc:name* |`HTTP`
|===
+
In this way, the endpoint will be reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet1`.

. After the endpoint, add a `set-payload` transformer, configured as shown:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-payload value="Hello #[message.inboundProperties.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`Hello #[message.inboundProperties.username]`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload`
|===
+
The MEL expression used in `value` will capture the inbound property `username`, which is passed as a query string parameter when calling the service.

. The full code of your flow should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="greetingFlow1" doc:name="greetingFlow1">
        <http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost" port="8081" path="greet1" doc:name="HTTP"/>
        <set-payload value="Hello #[message.inboundProperties.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
    </flow>
----

. Save and run project.

. Through a browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet1?username=yourName`. This will print the words `Hello yourName` in your browser.
=====

== Example 2 â€“ Dynamic Routing by Evaluating a Condition

In the previous example, if your call to the service doesn't include a `username` parameter, it results in an error. You can prevent this from happening by adding some flow control components. This example includes a Choice Router that verifies if the required parameter is being passed.

In this example, you use MEL to:

* evaluate conditions in a choice component
* access an inbound property
* dynamically set the payload

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. In a new flow, drag an HTTP endpoint and a Choice Router. Inside this Choice Router, add a Set Payload component in the space provided for the Default action and another Set Payload as a separate branch, as shown below.
+
[image]

. Open the HTTP Endpoint's properties editor and give it the path `greet2`. In this way, the endpoint will be reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet2`.

. Open the properties editor of the Set Payload transformer that sits in the Default space and set the *Display Name* to `Set Payload for valid username` and configure the *Value* with the following MEL expression:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
Hello #[message.inboundProperties.username]
----
+
This expression captures the inbound property `username`, which is passed as a query string parameter when calling the service.

. Open the properties editor of the other Set Payload transformer (the one that doesn't sit in the default space) and set the *Display Name* to Set Payload for individual username and configure the *Value* with the expression `#[No username provided]`.

. Open the Choice Router's properties editor to configure the routing logic. Double-click on row for the non-default route to provide a conditional expression. In the window that opens up, write the following MEL expression:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
#[message.inboundProperties.username == empty]
----
+
This expression accesses the username inbound property and determines whether or not it is `null` or an empty string. This expression returns neither Boolean true or false.
+
[TIP]
====
In MEL, the keyword `empty` tests the emptiness of a value, and returns boolean true for any of the following:

* `null`
* boolean false
* empty strings or strings with only white space
* 0 value numeric values
* empty collections
====

. Save and run project.

. Through a web browser, access the URL   `http://localhost:8081/greet2?username=yourName`. This prints the world `Hello yourName` in your browser.

. Then, access the URL again, but this time do not include any parameters. Verify that the expected output is received.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. In a new flow, add an `http:inbound-endpoint`
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost" port="8081" path="greet2" doc:name="HTTP"/>
----
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*exchange-pattern* |`request-response`
|*host* |`localhost`
|*port* |`8081`
|*path* |`greet2`
|*doc:name* |`HTTP`
|===
+
In this way, the endpoint will be reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet2`.

. After the endpoint, add a choice element with two possible outputs. One of these outputs will be the default, the other will evaluate a MEL expression:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<choice doc:name="Choice">
            <when>

            </when>
            <otherwise>

            </otherwise>
        </choice>
----
+
Inside the `when` tag, write the following MEL expression:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
expression="#[message.inboundProperties.username == empty]"
----
+
This expression accesses the username inbound property and determines whether or not it is `null` or an empty string. This expression returns either Boolean true or false.
+
[TIP]
====
In MEL, the keyword `empty` tests the emptiness of a value, and return boolean true for any of the following:

* `null`
* boolean false
* empty strings or strings with only white space
* 0 value numeric values
* empty collections
====

. On each of the two paths in the choice router, add a `set payload` transformer. In the first `set-payload` transformer, add the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`#[No username provided]`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload for invalid username`
|===
+
In the second set-payload transformer, use a MEL expression to access the inbound property:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`Hello #[message.inboundProperties.username]`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload for valid username`
|===
+
The MEL expression in the second `set-property's value` attribute captures the inbound property `username`, which is passed as a query string parameter when calling the service.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<choice doc:name="Choice">
            <when expression="#[message.inboundProperties.username == empty]">
                <set-payload value="#['No username provided']" doc:name="Set Payload for invalid username"/>
            </when>
            <otherwise>
                <set-payload value="Hello #[message.inboundProperties.username]" doc:name="Set Payload for valid username"/>
            </otherwise>
        </choice>
----

. The full code of your flow should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="greetingFlow2" doc:name="greetingFlow2">
        <http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost" port="8081" path="greet2" doc:name="HTTP"/>
        <choice doc:name="Choice">
            <when expression="#[message.inboundProperties.username == empty]">
                <set-payload value="#['No username provided']" doc:name="Set Payload for invalid username"/>
            </when>
            <otherwise>
                <set-payload value="Hello #[message.inboundProperties.username]" doc:name="Set Payload for valid username"/>
            </otherwise>
        </choice>
    </flow>
----

. Save and run project.

. Through a browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet1?username=yourName`. This prints the words `Hello yourName` in your browser.

. Then, access the URL again, but this time do not include any parameters. Verify that the expected output is received.
=====

== Example 3 - Variable Assignment and Evaluating Conditions

In this example, the service saves a CSV file with user data besides just returning a greeting. The call to the service will now include two parameters, username and age. The service stores these two parameters and adds a third boolean parameter that evaluates if the user is underage (if `age` is > `18`).

In this example, you will use MEL to:

* set a flow variable in the message
* generate an output based on evaluating the input
* access an inbound property
* dynamically set the payload

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. In a new flow, drag an HTTP endpoint, followed by an Expression component, then a Set Payload component, a File Endpoint, and finally another Set Payload Component.
+
[image]

. Open the HTTP Endpoint's properties editor and give it the *Path* `greet3`. In this way, the endpoint will be reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet3`.

. In the expression component, set the following MEL expression:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
flowVars.username = message.inboundProperties.username
----
+
This expression takes the value of the inbound property `username` and sets it as the flow variable `username`.
+
[TIP]
Because this MEL expression is used an *expression component*, it doesn't need to be surrounded with `#[]`.

. In the Set Payload transformer, set the *Value* to the following MEL expressions:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
#[message.inboundProperties.username], #[message.inboundProperties.age], #[message.inboundProperties.age > 18]
----
+
This will set the payload to a string that contains three comma separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns `true` or `false` depending on the user's age.

. In the properties editor of the File endpoint, set a path for the file to be saved.

. Open the properties editor of the final Set Payload transformer and set the *Value* field with the following MEL expression:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
Hello #[flowVars.username]
----
+
This expression will capture the flow variable `username`, which was created by the Expression Component in your flow.

. Save and run the project.

. Through a web browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet3?username=yourName&age=22`. This will print the words `Hello yourName` in your browser and also save a csv file that contains this data, plus the value `true` for the boolean parameter.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. In a new flow, add an `http:inbound-endpoint`. Configure it as shown:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost" port="8081" path="greet3" doc:name="HTTP"/>
----
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*exchange-pattern* |`request-response`
|*host* |`localhost`
|*port* |`8081`
|*path* |`greet3`
|*doc:name* |`HTTP`
|===
+
In this way, the endpoint will be reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet3`.

. After the endpoint, add an expression component that will use a MEL expression to record the inbound property `username` into a flowVar.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<expression-component doc:name="Expression"><![CDATA[flowVars.username = message.inboundProperties.username]]>
        </expression-component>
----
+
This expression takes the value of the inbound property `username` and sets it as flow variable `username`.
+
[TIP]
Since this MEL expression is used is an *expression component*, it doesn't need to be surrounded with brackets `#[]`.

. Add a Set Payload transformer and set the `value` field to a MEL expression:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-payload value="#[message.inboundProperties.username], #[message.inboundProperties.age], #[message.inboundProperties.age &gt;18]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`#[message.inboundProperties.username], #[message.inboundProperties.age], #[message.inboundProperties.age &gt;18]`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload`
|===
+
This will set the payload to a string that contains three comma separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns `true` or `false` depending on the user's age.

. Below, add a `file:outbound-endpoint` to send this data to file:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:outbound-endpoint path="path_of_your_choice" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="File"/>
----
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|`path` a|_(Example)_

`/Users/AaronMacbook/Downloads`

|`responseTimeout` |`10000`
|`doc:name` |`File`
|===

. Below, add another Set Payload transformer containing a MEL expression that references the flow variable that you set earliest in the flow:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-payload value="Hello #[flowVars.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
This expression will access the flow variable `username`, which was created by the Expression Component in your flow.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|`value` |`Hello #[flowVars.username]`
|`doc:name` |`Set Payload`
|===

. The full code of your flow should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="greetingFlow3" doc:name="greetingFlow3">
        <http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost" port="8081" path="greet3" doc:name="HTTP"/>
        <expression-component doc:name="Expression"><![CDATA[flowVars.username = message.inboundProperties.username]]></expression-component>
        <set-payload value="#[message.inboundProperties.username], #[message.inboundProperties.age], #[message.inboundProperties.age &gt;18]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
        <file:outbound-endpoint path="path_of_your_choice" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="File"/>
        <set-payload value="Hello #[flowVars.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
    </flow>
----

. Save and run your project.

. In a browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet3?username=yourNAme*age=22`. This will print the words `Hello yourName` in your browser and also save a csv file that contains this data, plus the value `True` for the boolean parameter.
=====

== Example 4 â€“ Creating Maps and Evaluating Conditions with DataMapper _(Enterprise)_

In this example, like in the previous one, the Mule application save a CSV file with user data and returns a greeting. The call to the service includes two parameters, `username` and `age`. The service stores these two parameters and adds a third boolean parameter that evaluates if the user is above a certain age if (`age > 18`). In this case, however, the mapping between input and output fields and the generation of the third field is performed by a [DataMapper] component.

In this example, you will use MEL to:

* set a flow in the message
* set a map as your message payload
* generate an output based on evaluating the input within DataMapper
* access an inbound property
* dynamically set the payload

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. In the new flow, drag an HTTP endpoint, followed by an Expression Component, then a Set Payload transformer, a DataMapper transformer, a File Endpoint, and finally another Set Payload transformer
+
[image]

. Open the HTTP endpoint's properties editor and give it the path `greet4`. In this way, the endpoint will be reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet4`.

. In the expression component, set the following MEL expression:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
flowVars.username = message.inboundProperties.username
----
+
[TIP]
Since this MEL expression is used in an *expression component*, it doesn't need to be surrounded with `#[]`.

. In the Set Payload transformer, set the *Value* field to the following MEL expression:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
#[['username' : message.inboundProperties.username, 'age' : message.inboundProperties.age]]
----
+
This will set the payload to a map that contains two key: value pairs.

. In the DataMapper properties editor, configure the field as shown:

* In the Input, select *Map<k.v>* type and *User defined* structure.

* In the Output, select *CSV* type and *User defined* structure.
+
[image]

. For the input, click *Edit Fields* to open the Define the Map dialog.

. Give your map a *Name* and *Type*, then create two fields by clicking the green plus sign:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type
|*username* |String
|*age* |Integer
|===
+
[image]

. For the Output, click *Edit Fields*, then give the output a *Name*, select *Delimiter*, and create three fields as shown:
+
[image]

. Click *Create Mapping* to trigger DataMapper to generate the mappings.

. DataMapper now displays the mapping between input and output fields. The third output field (of_age) needs a MEL expression to get its value. Select it and then write the following MEL expression in the input box below:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
input.age>18
----
+
The resulting mapping should look like this:
+
[image]

. In the File endpoint, set a path of your choice for the file to be saved.

. Open the properties editor of the final Set Payload transformer and set *Value* field with the following:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
Hello #[flowVars.username]
----
+
This expression will access the flow variable `username`, which was created by the Expression Component in your flow.

. Save and run project.

. In a browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet4?username=yourName&age=22`. This will print the words `Hello yourName` in your browser and also save a csv file that contains this data, plus the value `true` for the boolean parameter.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. In a new flow, add an `http:inbound-endpoint` configured as shown.

|*path* |`greet4`
|*doc:name* |`HTTP`
|===
+
In this way, the endpoint is reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet4`.

. After the endpoint, add an expression component that will use a MEL expression to record the inbound property `username` into a flow variable of the same time
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<expression-component doc:name="Expression"><![CDATA[flowVars.username = message.inboundProperties.username]]>
        </expression-component>

+
[TIP]
Since this MEL expression is used in an *expression component*, it doesn't need to be surrounded with `#[]`.

. Add a set-payload transformer and set value attribute to a MEL expression:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-payload value="#[['username' : message.inboundProperties.username, 'age' : message.inboundProperties.age]]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`#[['username' : message.inboundProperties.username, 'age' : message.inboundProperties.age]]`
|*doc:name* |Set Payload

+
This will set the payload to a map of key: value pairs that contains username and age.

. Next, add a data-mapper:transformer element.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<data-mapper:transform doc:name="Map To CSV"/>
----
+
In order to configure the DataMapper, transition to Studio's Visual Editor.

. In the DataMapper properties editor, configure the following:

* In the input, select *Map<k,v> type and *User Defined* structure.

* In the output, select CSV type and *User Defined* structure.
+
[image]

. For the input, click *Edit Fields* to open the Define the Map dialog.

. Give your map a *Name* and *Type*, then create two fields by clicking the green plus sign:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type
|*username* |String
|*age* |Integer
|===
+

[source,text,linenums]
----
input.age>18
----
+
The resulting mapping should look like this:

    </flow>
----

. Save and run your project.

. In a browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet4?username=yourName&age=22`. This will print the words `Hello yourName` in your browser and also save a csv file that contains this data, plus the value `true` for the boolean parameter.
=====

== Example 5 - Using Xpath

In all previous examples, calls to the service were made via GET requests that included query parameters. In this example, the service you create is an API that accepts POST requests with XML bodies. The required XML includes two parameters, `username` and `age`. The service stores these two parameters and adds a third boolean parameter that evaluates if the user is above a certain age (`if age > 18`).

In this example, you use a MEL to:

* set a flow variable in the message
* generate an output based on evaluating the input
* parse an XML input through an xpath query
* dynamically set the payload

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. In a new flow, drag an HTTP endpoint, followed by an Expression Component, a Set Payload transformer, a File endpoint, and another Set Payload transformer.
+
[image]

. Open the HTTP Endpoint's properties editor and give it the path `greet5`. In the way, the endpoint is be reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet5`.

. Open the Expression Component's properties editor and set the following MEL expressions:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
flowVars.username = xpath3('/user/username').text
----
+
This expression calculates the result of the xpath function and sets it as the value of the flow variable `username`.
+
[TIP]
Since this MEL expression is used in an *expression component*, it doesn't need to be surrounded with `#[]`.
+
Since the payload is in XML, *xpath* is needed to parse it.

. In the Set Payload transformer, set the *Value* field to the following:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
#[xpath3('/user/username').text],
#[xpath3('/user/age').text],
#[xpath3('/user/age').text > 18]
----
+
This will set the payload to a string that contains three comma separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns `true` or `false` depending on the user's age. Once again, as the payload is in XML, *xpath* is needed to parse it.

. In the File endpoint, set a path of your choice to determine where the .csv file should be saved.

. Open the properties editor of the final Set Payload transformer and set the *Value* field with the following:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
Hello #[flowVars.username]
----
+
This expression will access the flow variable username, which was created by the Expression Component earlier in your flow.

. Save and run your project.

. You must now send the HTTP endpoint an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached XML file. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8081/greet5` attaching an XML to the body of the message. A sample XML is provided below:
+
[TIP]
The easiest way to do this is to send a POST via a browser extension such a [Postman] (for Google Chrome) or the [curl] command line utility.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<user>
  <username>test</username>
  <age>21</age>
</user>
----
+
This will print the words `Hello yourName` in your browser and also save a csv file that contains this data, plus the value `true` for the boolean parameter.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. In a new flow, add an `http:inbound-endpoint` configured as shown.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost" port="8081" path="greet5" doc:name="HTTP"/>
----
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*exchange-pattern* |`request-response`
|*host* ||`localhost`
|*port* |`8081`
|*path* |`greet5`
|*doc:name* |`HTTP`
|===
+
In this way, the endpoint is to be reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet5`.

. After the endpoint, add an Expression Component that will use a MEL expression to record the inbound property `username` into a flow variable. Because the payload XML file, it must be parsed with xpath.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<expression-component doc:name="Expression"><![CDATA[flowVars.username = xpath3('/user/username').text]]></expression-component>
----
+
The expression calculate the result of the xpath function and sets it as the value of the flow variable `username`.
+
[TIP]
Since this MEL expression is used in an *expression component*, it isn't surrounded with brackets `#[]`

. Add a set-payload transformer and set the `value` attribute to a comma-separated list of MEL expressions:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-payload value="#[xpath('/user/username').text], #[xpath('/user/age').text], #[xpath('/user/age').text &gt; 18]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`#[xpath('/user/username').text], #[xpath('/user/age').text], #[xpath('/user/age').text &gt; 18]`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload`
|===
+
This will set the payload to a string that contains three comma separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns `true` or `false` depending on the user's age. Once again, as the payload is in XML, *xpath* is needed to parse it.

. Add a `file:outbound-endpoint` to output the payload into a csv file.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:outbound-endpoint path="path_of_your_choice" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="File"/>
----
+
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*path* a|(Example)

`Users/AaronMacBook/Downloads`
|*responseTimeout* |`10000`
|*doc:name* |`File`
|===

. Below, add another set-payload transformer with a value containing a MEL expression that references the flow variable `username` that you set earlier in the flow:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-payload value="Hello #[flowVars.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`Hello #[flowVars.username]`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload`
|===

. The full code of your flow should look like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="greetingFlow5" doc:name="greetingFlow5">
        <http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost" port="8081" path="greet5" doc:name="HTTP"/>
        <expression-component doc:name="Expression"><![CDATA[flowVars.username = xpath('/user/username').text]]></expression-component>
        <set-payload value="#[xpath('/user/username').text], #[xpath('/user/age').text], #[xpath('/user/age').text &gt; 18]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
        <file:outbound-endpoint path="path_of_your_choice" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="File"/>
        <set-payload value="Hello #[flowVars.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
    </flow>
----

. Save and run your project.

. You must now sent the HTTP endpoint an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached XML file. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8081/greet5`, attaching an XML to the body of the message. A sample XML is provided below.

== Example 6 - Working with Java Objects

This example is just like example 5, except that the service now receives JSON inputs rather than of XML.

The JSON input includes two parameters, username and age. The service stores these two parameters and adds a third boolean parameter that evaluates if the user is above a certain age (if age>18). Mule first transforms the JSON object into a Java object so that MEL expressions can access the object's attributes.

In this example, you will use MEL to:

* set a flow variable in the message
* generate an output based on evaluating the input
* access a Java object's attributes
* dynamically set the payload

=== Studio Visual Editor

. In a new flow, drag an HTTP endpoint, followed by a JSON to Object transformer, an Expression Component, a Set Payload transformer, a File endpoint, and another Set Payload transformer.
+
[image]

. Open the HTTP Endpoint's properties editor and give it the path greet6. In this way, the endpoint is reached via the URI http://localhost:8081/greet6

. Open the properties editor of the JSON to Object transformer and click the Advanced tab. Set the Return Class to java.lang.Object . With this configuration, the JSON input becomes a Java object with attributes that can be easily called by using object.attribute notation.

. In the expression component, set the following MEL expression that accesses an attribute of the object and sets that as the value of a flow variable called username:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
flowVars.username = payload.username
----
+
[TIP]
Since this MEL expression is used in an expression component, it doesn't need to be surrounded with #[].

. In the Set Payload component, set the Value field to the following comma-separated list of MEL expressions:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
#[payload.username],
#[payload.age],
#[payload.age > 18]
----
+
This sets the payload to a string that contains three comma-separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns true or false depending on the user's age.

. In the File endpoint, set a Path of your choice to determine where the csv files should be saved.

. Open the properties editor of the final Set Payload transformer and set the Value field with the following:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
Hello #[flowVars.username]
----
+
This expression accesses the flow variable username, which was created by the Expression Component earlier in your flow.

. Save and run the project.

. You must now send the HTTP endpoint an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached JSON file.
Send a POST request to http://localhost:8081/greet6, attaching a JSON object the body of the message. A sample JSON is provided below
+
[TIP]
The easiest way to do this is by sending a POST via a browser extension such as Postman (for Google Chrome) or the curl command line utility.
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
{ "username": "test", "age" : 21 }
----
+
This will print the words Hello yourName in your browser and also save a csv file that contains this data, plus the value true for the boolean parameter.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. In a new flow, add an http:inbound-endpoint configured as shown.

|===
|Attribute |Value
|doc:name |HTTP
|exchange-pattern |request-response
|host |localhost
|path |greet6
|port |8081
|===
+
In this way, the endpoint is reached via the URI http://localhost:8081/greet6.

. After the endpoint, add a json:json-to-object-transformer.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<json:json-to-object-transformer doc:name="JSON to Object" returnClass="java.lang.Object"/>
----
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]

|returnClass |java.lang.Object
|doc:name |JSON to Object
|===
+
With this configuration, the JSON input becomes a Java object with attributes that can be easily called by using object.attribute notation.

. After the transformer, add an expression component that uses a MEL expression to access the Java object's username attribute and assign its value into a flow variable of the same name.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<expression-component doc:name="Expression"><![CDATA[flowVars.username = payload.username]]></expression-component>
----
+
[TIP]
Since this MEL expression is used in an expression component, it doesn't need to be surrounded with #[].

. Add a set-payload transformer and set the value attribute to a comma-separated list of MEL expressions:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-payload value="#[payload.username], #[payload.age], #[payload.age &gt; 18]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|`value` |`#[payload.username], #[payload.age], #[payload.age &gt; 18]`
|`doc:name` |`Set Payload`
|===
+
This sets the payload to a string that contains three comma-separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns true or false depending on the user's age.

. Add a file:outbound-endpoint to output the payload into a csv file.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:outbound-endpoint path="path_of_your_choice" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="File"/>

. Below, add another set-payload transformer, containing a MEL expression that references a flow variable:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<set-payload value="Hello #[flowVars.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
This expression accesses the flow variable username, which was created by the Expression Component earlier in your flow.
