This document walks through a few simple examples that introduce most of the basic implementations of Mule Expression Language (MEL). Each example includes a step-by-step guide for creating the flow in Studio's visual editor or in XML. You can also jump straight to the complete code for all six examples, which you can copy and manipulate further in your own applications.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule Expression Language's xref:mule-expression-language-basic-syntax.adoc[basic syntax] and are comfortable building and running Mule applications using xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Mule Studio] or XML.

If you aren't yet familiar with how to access information about the Mule messages that pass through your applications, consider following this xref:general:getting-started:mule-message.adoc[tutorial], which walks you through both examining your Mule message and its data structure and writing simple MEL expressions.

== Example 1 – Accessing Properties

This example creates a simple web service that takes an HTTP request that includes a `username` parameter and returns a greeting using that `username`.

In this example, you can use MEL to:

* Access an inbound property
* Dynamically set the payload

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. In a new flow, drag an HTTP connector and a Set Payload transformer.
+
image::greeting-flow.png[greeting+flow]
+
. Open the HTTP connector's properties editor and give it the path `greet1`. Then create a Connector Configuration element for it and set its host to `localhost` and port to `8081`. In this way, the connector is reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet1`
. Open the Set Payload's properties editor and set the value field with the following MEL expression:
+
----
Hello #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username]
----
+
This expression captures the inbound property "username", which is passed as a query string parameter when calling the service.
+
. Save and run the project.
. Through a web browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet1?username=yourName`
+
The response displays the words `Hello yourName` in your browser.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. In a new flow, add an `http:listener` and configure it with the path `greet1`.
+
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="greet1" doc:name="HTTP"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*config-ref* |HTTP_Listener_Configuration
|*path* |greet1
|*doc:name* |HTTP
|===
+
In this way, you can reach the connector from the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet1`.
+
. Create a Connector Configuration element for it with a name that matches the referenced element in `config-ref`. Set the Port to 8081 and the Path to `localhost`
+
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="localhost" port="8081" doc:name="HTTP Listener Configuration"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|`name` |`HTTP_Listener_Configuration`
|*host* |`localhost`
|*port* |`8081`
|*path* |greet1
|*doc:name* |`HTTP_Listener_Configuration`
|===
+
. After the connector, add a `set-payload` transformer, configured as shown:
+
[source,xml]
----
<set-payload value="Hello #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`Hello #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username]`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload`
|===
+
The MEL expression used in `value` captures the inbound property `username`, which is passed as a query string parameter when calling the service.
+
. The full code of your flow should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/mule-expression-language-examples_1.xml[]
----
+
. Save and run the project.
. Through a browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet1?username=yourName` +
This displays the words `Hello yourName` in your browser.

=====

== Example 2 – Dynamic Routing by Evaluating a Condition

In the previous example, if your call to the service doesn't include a `username` parameter, it results in an error. You can prevent this from happening by adding some flow control components. This example includes a Choice Router that verifies if the required parameter is being passed.

In this example, you can use MEL to:

* Evaluate conditions in a choice component
* Access an inbound property
* Dynamically set the payload

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. In a new flow, drag an HTTP connector and a Choice Router. Inside this Choice Router, add a Set Payload component in the space provided for the Default action and another Set Payload as a separate branch, as shown below.
+
image::greet2.png[]
+
. Open the HTTP Connector's properties editor and give it the path `greet2`. In the Connector Configuration field, simply select the same global element you created for the previous example out of the dropdown list. By setting the path to greet2, you can access the connector from a browser with the `http://localhost:8081/greet2` URI.
. Open the properties editor of the Set Payload transformer that sits in the Default space and set the *Display Name* to `Set Payload for valid username` and configure the *Value* with the following MEL expression:
+
----
Hello #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username]
----
+
This expression captures the inbound property "username", which is passed as a query string parameter when calling the service.
. Open the properties editor of the other Set Payload transformer (the one that doesn't sit in the default space) and set the *Display Name* to `Set Payload for invalid username` and configure the *Value* with the expression `&#x0023;['No username provided']`.
. Open the Choice Router's properties editor to configure the routing logic. Double click on row for the non-default route to provide a conditional expression. In the window that opens up, write the following MEL expression:
+
----
#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username == empty]
----
+
This expression accesses the username inbound property and determines whether or not it is `null` or an empty string. This expression returns either Boolean true or false.
+
[TIP]
====
In MEL, the keyword `empty` tests the emptiness of a value, and returns boolean `true` for any of the following:

* `null`
* boolean false
* empty strings or strings with only white space
* 0 value numeric values
* empty collections
====
+
. Save and run the project.
. Through a web browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet2?username=yourName`. This displays the words `Hello yourName` in your browser.
. Then, access the URL again, but this time do not include any parameters. Verify that the expected output is received.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. In a new flow, add an `<http:listener` element, with its path set to `greet2` and that references the global element you created in the previous example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="greet2" doc:name="HTTP"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*config-ref* |`HTTP_Listener_Configuration`
|*path* |`greet2`
|*doc:name* |`HTTP`
|===
+
. You can reach the connector using the `http://localhost:8081/greet2` URI.
. After the connector, add a choice element with two possible outputs. One of these outputs is the default, the other evaluates a MEL expression.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<choice doc:name="Choice">
    <when>

    </when>
    <otherwise>

    </otherwise>
</choice>
----
+
Inside the `when` tag, write the following MEL expression:
+
----
expression="#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username == empty]"
----
+
This expression accesses the username inbound property and determines whether or not it is `null` or an empty string. This expression returns either Boolean true or false.
+
[TIP]
====
In MEL, the keyword `empty` tests the emptiness of a value, and returns boolean true for any of the following:

* `null`
* boolean false
* empty strings or strings with only white space
* 0 value numeric values
* empty collections
====
+
. On each of the two paths in the choice router, add a `set-payload` transformer. In the first `set-payload` transformer, add the following attributes:
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`#[No username provided]`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload for invalid username`
|===
+
In the second set-payload transformer, use a MEL expression to access the inbound property:
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`"Hello #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username]"`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload for valid username`
|===
+
The MEL expression in the second `set-property` value attribute captures the inbound property `username`, which is passed as a query string parameter when calling the service.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/mule-expression-language-examples_2a.xml[]
----
+
. The full code of your flow should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/mule-expression-language-examples_2b.xml[]
----
+
. Save and run the project.
. Through a browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet1?username=yourName`
+
This displays `Hello yourName` in your browser.
+
. Then, access the URL again, but this time do not include any parameters. Verify that the expected output is received.

=====

== Example 3 – Variable Assignment and Evaluating Conditions

In this example, the service saves a CSV file with user data besides just returning a greeting. The call to the service now includes two parameters, `username` and `age`. The service stores these two parameters and adds a third boolean parameter that evaluates if the user is above a certain age (if `age` is > 18).

In this example, you uses MEL to:

* Set a flow variable in the message
* Generate an output based on evaluating the input
* Access an inbound property
* Dynamically set the payload

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. In a new flow, drag an HTTP connector, followed by an Expression component, then a Set Payload component, a File Endpoint, and finally another Set Payload Component.
+
image::greeting3.png[]
+
. Open the HTTP connector's properties editor and give it the *Path* `greet3`. By setting the path to greet3, you can access the connector from a browser with the `http://localhost:8081/greet3` URI.
. In the expression component, set the following MEL expression:
+
----
flowVars.username = message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username
----
+
This expression takes the value of the inbound property `username` and sets it as the flow variable `username`.
+
[TIP]
Because this MEL expression is used in an *expression component,* it doesn't need to be surrounded with `&#x0023;[]`.
+
. In the Set Payload transformer, set the *Value* to the following MEL expressions:
+
----
#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username], #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.age], #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.age > 18]
----
+
This sets the payload to a string that contains three comma-separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns `true` or `false` depending on the user's age.
+
. In the properties editor of the File endpoint, set a path for the file to be saved.
. Open the properties editor of the final Set Payload transformer and set the *Value* field with the following MEL expression:
+
----
Hello #[flowVars.username]
----
+
This expression captures the flow variable `username`, which was created by the Expression Component in your flow.
. Save and run the project.
. Through a web browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet3?username=yourName&age=22`
+
This displays the words `Hello yourName` in your browser and also saves a CSV file that contains this data, plus the value `true` for the boolean parameter.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. In a new flow, add an `http:listener`. Configure it as shown:
+
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="greet3" doc:name="HTTP"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*config-ref* |`HTTP_Listener_Configuration`
|*path* |`greet3`
|*doc:name* |`HTTP`
|===
+
. You can reach the connector using the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet3`.
. After the connector, add an expression component that uses a MEL expression to record the inbound property `username` into a flowVar.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<expression-component doc:name="Expression"><![CDATA[flowVars.username = message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username]]>
</expression-component>
----
+
This expression takes the value of the inbound property `username` and sets it as the flow variable `username`.
+
[TIP]
Because this MEL expression is in an *expression component*, don't surround the expression with `&#x0023;[]` brackets.
+
. Add a Set Payload transformer and set the `value` field to a MEL expression:
+
----
<set-payload value="#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username], #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.age], #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.age &gt;18]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |

----
#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.username], #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.age], #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.age &gt;18]
----

|*doc:name* |`Set Payload`
|===
+
This sets the payload to a string that contains three comma-separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns `true` or `false` depending on the user's age.
+
. Below, add a `file:outbound-endpoint` to send this data to a file:
+
[source,xml]
----
<file:outbound-endpoint path="path_of_your_choice" responseTimeout="10000" doc:name="File"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|`path` |`/Users/Me/Downloads` (example)
|`responseTimeout` |`10000`
|`doc:name` |`File`
|===
+
. Below, add another Set Payload transformer containing a MEL expression that references the flow variable that you set earlier in the flow:
+
[source,xml]
----
<set-payload value="Hello #[flowVars.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
This expression accesses the flow variable `username`, which was created by the Expression Component in your flow.
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|value |`Hello #[flowVars.username]`
|doc:name |`Set Payload`
|===
+
. The full code of your flow should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/mule-expression-language-examples_3.xml[]
----
+
. Save and run your project.
. In a browser, access the URL `http://localhost:8081/greet3?username=yourName&age=22`
+
This displays `Hello yourName` in your browser and also saves a CSV file that contains this data, plus the value `true` for the boolean parameter.

=====


== Example 4 – Using Xpath

In all the previous examples, calls to the service were made via GET requests that included query parameters. In this example, the service you create is an API that accepts POST requests with XML bodies. The required XML includes two parameters, `username` and `age`. The service stores these two parameters and adds a third boolean parameter that evaluates if the user is above a certain age (if `age > 18`)

In this example, you use MEL to:

* Set a flow variable in the message
* Generate an output based on evaluating the input
* Parse an XML input through an xpath query
* Dynamically set the payload

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. In a new flow, drag an HTTP connector, followed by an Expression Component, a Set Payload transformer, a File endpoint, and another Set Payload transformer.
+
image::greeting-5.png[greeting+5]
+
. Open the HTTP connector's properties editor and give it the path `greet5`. In this way, the connector is reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet5`.
. Open the Expression Component's properties editor and set the following MEL expression:
+
----
flowVars.username = xpath3('/user/username').text
----
+
This expression calculates the result of the xpath3 function and sets it as the value of the flow variable `username`.
+
[TIP]
Because this MEL expression is in an *expression component*, don't surround the expression with `&#x0023;[]` brackets.
+
Since the payload is in XML, *xpath3* is needed to parse it.
+
. In the Set Payload transformer, set the *Value* field to the following:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
#[xpath3('/user/username').text],
#[xpath3('/user/age').text],
#[xpath3('/user/age').text > 18]
----
+
This sets the payload to a string that contains three comma-separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns `true` or `false` depending on the user's age. Once again, as the payload is in XML, *xpath3* is needed to parse it.
+
. In the File endpoint, set a path of your choice to determine where the .csv file should be saved.
. Open the properties editor of the final Set Payload transformer and set the *Value* field with the following:
+
----
Hello #[flowVars.username]
----
+
This expression accesses the flow variable username, which was created by the Expression Component earlier in your flow.
+
. Save and run your project.
. You must now send the HTTP connector an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached XML file.
+
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8081/greet5` attaching an XML to the body of the message. A sample XML is provided below.
+
[TIP]
The easiest way to do this is to send a POST via a browser extension such as Postman (for Google Chrome) or the http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] command line utility.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<user>
  <username>test</username>
  <age>21</age>
</user>
----
+
This displays the words `Hello yourName` in your browser and also saves a CSV file that contains this data, plus the value `true` for the boolean parameter.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. In a new flow, add an `http:listener `configured as shown.
+
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="greet5" doc:name="HTTP"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*config-ref* |`HTTP_Listener_Configuration`
|*path* |`greet5`
|*doc:name* |`HTTP`
|===
+
In this way, the connector is reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet5`.
+
. After the connector, add an Expression Component that uses a MEL expression to record the inbound property `username` into a flow variable. Because the payload is an XML file, it must be parsed with xpath3.
+
[source,xml]
----
<expression-component doc:name="Expression"><![CDATA[flowVars.username = xpath3('/user/username').text]]></expression-component>
----
+
This expression calculates the result of the xpath3 function and sets it as the value of the flow variable `username`.
+
[TIP]
Because this MEL expression is in an *expression component*, don't surround the expression with `&#x0023;[]` brackets.
+
. Add a set-payload transformer and set the `value` attribute to a comma-separated list of MEL expressions:
+
[source,xml]
----
<set-payload value="#[xpath3('/user/username').text], #[xpath3('/user/age').text], #[xpath3('/user/age').text &gt; 18]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |

----
#[xpath3('/user/username').text], #[xpath3('/user/age').text], #[xpath3('/user/age').text &gt; 18]
----

|*doc:name* |`Set Payload`
|===
+
This sets the payload to a string that contains three comma-separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns `true` or `false` depending on the user's age. Once again, as the payload is in XML, *xpath3* is needed to parse it.
+
. Add a `file:outbound-endpoint` to output the payload into a CSV file.

. Below, add another set-payload transformer with a value containing a MEL expression that references the flow variable `username` that you set earlier in the flow.:
+
[source,xml]
----
<set-payload value="Hello #[flowVars.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`Hello #[flowVars.username]`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload`
|===
+
. The full code of your flow should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/mule-expression-language-examples_5.xml[]
----
+
. Save and run your project. You must now send the HTTP connector an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached XML file. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8081/greet5`, attaching an XML to the body of the message. A sample XML is provided below.
+
[TIP]
The easiest way to do this is by sending a POST via a browser extension such as Postman (for Google Chrome) or the http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] command line utility.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<user>
  <username>test</username>
  <age>21</age>
</user>
----
+
This displays the words `Hello yourName` in your browser and also saves a CSV file that contains this data, plus the value `true` for the boolean parameter.

=====

== Example 5 – Working with Java Objects

This example is just like example 4, except that the service now receives JSON inputs rather than of XML.

The JSON input includes two parameters, `username` and `age`. The service stores these two parameters and adds a third boolean parameter that evaluates if the user is above a certain age (if `age>18`). Mule first transforms the JSON object into a Java object so that MEL expressions can access the object's attributes.

In this example, you can use MEL to:

* Set a flow variable in the message
* Generate an output based on evaluating the input
* Access a Java object's attributes
* Dynamically set the payload

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. In a new flow, drag an HTTP connector, followed by a JSON to Object transformer, an Expression Component, a Set Payload transformer, a File endpoint, and another Set Payload transformer.
+
image::greeting-6.png[greeting+6]
+
. Open the HTTP connector's properties editor and give it the path `greet6`. In this way, the connector is reached via the URI `http://localhost:8081/greet6`.
. Open the properties editor of the JSON to Object transformer and click the *Advanced* tab. Set the *Return Class* to `java.lang.Object`. With this configuration, the JSON input becomes a Java object with attributes that can be easily called by using `object.attribute` notation.
. In the expression component, set the following MEL expression that accesses an attribute of the object and sets that as the value of a flow variable called `username`:
+
----
flowVars.username = payload.username
----
+
[TIP]
Because this MEL expression is in an *expression component*, don't surround the expression with `&#x0023;[]` brackets.
+
. In the Set Payload component, set the *Value* field to the following comma-separated list of MEL expressions:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
#[payload.username],
#[payload.age],
#[payload.age > 18]
----
+
This sets the payload to a string that contains three comma-separated values. The third of these values is evaluating a condition and returns `true` or `false` depending on the user's age.
+
. In the File endpoint, set a *Path* of your choice to determine where the CSV files should be saved.
. Open the properties editor of the final Set Payload transformer and set the *Value* field with the following:
+
----
Hello #[flowVars.username]
----
+
This expression accesses the flow variable `username`, which was created by the Expression Component earlier in your flow.
+
. Save and run the project.
. You must now send the HTTP connector an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached JSON file.
. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8081/greet6`, attaching a JSON object the body of the message. A sample JSON is provided below.

With this configuration, the JSON input becomes a Java object with attributes that can be easily called by using `object.attribute` notation.
. After the transformer, add an expression component that uses a MEL expression to access the Java object's `username` attribute and assign its value into a flow variable of the same name.
+
[source,xml]
----
<expression-component doc:name="Expression"><![CDATA[flowVars.username = payload.username]]></expression-component>

. Below, add another set-payload transformer, containing a MEL expression that references a flow variable:
+
[source,xml]
----
<set-payload value="Hello #[flowVars.username]" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
----
+
This expression accesses the flow variable `username`, which was created by the Expression Component earlier in your flow.
+
[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
|*value* |`Hello #[flowVars.username]`
|*doc:name* |`Set Payload`
|===
+
. The full code of your flow should look like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/mule-expression-language-examples_6.xml[]
----
+
. Save and run the project. You must now send the HTTP connector an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached JSON file.
+
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8081/greet6`, attaching a JSON object the body of the message. A sample JSON is provided below.
+
[TIP]
The easiest way to do this is to send a POST via a browser extension such as Postman (for Google Chrome) or the http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] command line utility.
+
----
{ "username": "test", "age" : 21 }
----
+
This displays the words `Hello yourName` in your browser and also saves a CSV file that contains this data, plus the value `true` for the boolean parameter.
