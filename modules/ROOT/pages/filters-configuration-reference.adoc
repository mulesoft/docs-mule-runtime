== Not filter

Inverts the enclosed filter. For example, if the filter would normally return true for a specific message, it now returns false, and vice versa.

=== Attributes of <not-filter...>

[%header,cols="5*"]

|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Identifies the filter so that other elements can reference it. Required if the filter is defined at the global level.

|Name |Cardinality |Description
|abstract-filter |0..1 |A placeholder for filter elements, which control which messages are handled.

== And filter

Returns true only if all the enclosed filters return true.

== Or filter

Returns true if any of the enclosed filters returns true.

=== Attributes of <or-filter...>

|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Identifies the filter so that other elements can reference it. Required if the filter is defined at the global level.

== Wildcard filter

A filter that matches string messages against wildcards. It performs matches with "\*", for example, "jms.events.*" would catch "jms.events.customer" and "jms.events.receipts". This filter accepts a comma-separated list of patterns, so more than one filter pattern can be matched for a given argument: "jms.events.\*, jms.actions.*" matches "jms.events.system" and "jms.actions" but not "jms.queue".

=== Attributes of <wildcard-filter...>

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Identifies the filter so that other elements can reference it. Required if the filter is defined at the global level.
|pattern |string |yes |  |The property name and optionally a value to use when matching. If the expression is just a property name, the filter will check that the property exists. Users can also use '=' and '!=' to determine a specific value for a property.
|caseSensitive |boolean |no |true |If false, the comparison ignores case.
|===

No Child Elements of <wildcard-filter...>


== Expression filter

A filter that can evaluate a range of expressions. It supports some base expression types such as header, payload (payload type), regex, and wildcard.

=== Attributes of <expression-filter...>

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Identifies the filter so that other elements can reference it. Required if the filter is defined at the global level.
|evaluator |expressionFilterEvaluators |no |  |The expression evaluator to use. The expression filter supports some types such as header, payload, exception, wildcard, and regex, that are built-in filters not registered with the ExpressionEvaluatorManager. All others are registered with the ExpressionEvaluatorManager. Where XPath, bean, and ONGL are used, the expression should be a boolean expression.
|expression |string |yes |  |The expression that will be evaluated. This should always be a boolean expression. The syntax of the expression will be determined by the expression language being used.
|customEvaluator |name (no spaces) |no |  |Must be set if the evaluator is set to custom. The custom evaluator must be registered with the ExpressionEvaluatorManager if it is to be used here.
|nullReturnsTrue |boolean |no |  |Whether the filter should return true if the specified expression returns null.
|===

No Child Elements of <expression-filter...>


== Regex filter

A filter that matches string messages against a regular expression. The Java regular expression engine (java.util.regex.Pattern) is used.

=== Attributes of <regex-filter...>

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Identifies the filter so that other elements can reference it. Required if the filter is defined at the global level.
|pattern |string |yes |  |The property name and optionally a value to use when matching. If the expression is just a property name, the filter will check that the property exists. Users can also use '=' and '!=' to determine a specific value for a property.
|flags |string |no |  |Comma-separated list of flags for compiling the pattern. Valid values are CASE_INSENSITIVE, MULTILINE, DOTALL, UNICODE_CASE and CANON_EQ.
|===

No Child Elements of <regex-filter...>

== Message property filter

A filter that matches properties on a message. This can be very useful, as the message properties represent all the meta information about the message from the underlying transport, so for a message received over HTTP, you can check for HTTP headers and so forth. The pattern should be expressed as a key/value pair, such as "propertyName=value". If you want to compare more than one property, you can use the logic filters for And, Or, and Not expressions. By default, the comparison is case sensitive, which you can override with the 'caseSensitive' property.

=== Attributes of <message-property-filter...>

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Identifies the filter so that other elements can reference it. Required if the filter is defined at the global level.
|pattern |string |yes |  |The property name and optionally a value to use when matching. If the expression is just a property name, the filter will check that the property exists. Users can also use '=' and '!=' to determine a specific value for a property.
|caseSensitive |boolean |no |true |If false, the comparison ignores case.
|scope |enumeration |no |outbound |Property scope to lookup the value from (default: outbound)

|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Identifies the filter so that other elements can reference it. Required if the filter is defined at the global level.
|expectedType |class name |yes |  |The expected class used in the comparison.
