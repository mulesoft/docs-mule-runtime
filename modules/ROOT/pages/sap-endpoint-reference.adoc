[NOTE]
This endpoint requires a separate license. Contact mailto:sales@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft] to evaluate or use this endpoint.

== Background

Mule ESB supports SAP integration through an SAP-certified Java connector. The connector leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries, which enable Mule applications to:

* send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC
* receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC
* transform all SAP objects (JCoFunction & IDocs) both to and from XML
* execute Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI) functions using all of the following types of Remote Function Calls (RFC)
** sRFC (synchronous RFC)
** tRFC (transactional RFC)
** qRFC (queued RFC)
* act as a JCo Server to be called as a BAPI over the following protocols:
** sRFC
** tRFC
** qRFC
+
image::sap-transport-image-01-1.png[]

== Pre-requisites

This endpoint requires the following SAP libraries:

* Java Connector (JCo) library (Platform-dependent)
* IDoc library

Note that the JCo library is dependent on both your hardware platform and operating system, so you need to download the correct version for the local drive running Mule Studio.

Three files are required for both libraries:

* both multi-platform Java libraries:
** sapjco3.jar
** sapidoc3.jar

* one of the JCo platform-specific native libraries:
** sapjco3.dll (Windows)
** libsapjco3.jnilib (Mac OS X)
** libsapjco3.so (Linux)

[WARNING]
If you deploy to a platform that is different from the one used for development, you *must* change the native library before generating the zip file.

Download the requisite http://service.sap.com/connectors[SAP libraries]. To perform this download, you must have an SAP user ID.

[NOTE]
To enable SAP to communicate with Mule, you need to perform additional SAP configuration. SAP configuration facilitates many options, which should be set by your SAP system administrator. MuleSoft will soon provide a simple sample configuration.

== Enabling Your Studio Project for SAP

If no native SAP libraries exist within your system, Mule simply uses the SAP Endpoint as any other Java Library; reference it in the project `classpath`, and Studio automatically includes the libraries when generating the Mule application zip file.

The ESB server includes the application's `lib` directory in the `Java Native Library Path` environment variable.

[NOTE]
If you are using Mule 3.2.1 or lower, you must install the native libraries on the server hosting the Mule application that contains your SAP endpoint. As well, you must configure Mule ESB's native library path.

To run your SAP-enabled application inside Studio you must complete the following two tasks:

* create the directory `src/main/app/lib`
* copy all three libraries to this directory

. In the *Package Explorer* pane, which resides of the left side of the Mule application window, click the plus image:add.png[(plus)] icon to the left of your Mule project name to expand the resource tree.

. Click the plus icon to the left of `src`.
. Click the plus icon to the left of `main`.
. Click the plus icon to the left of `app`.
. Right-click `app`, select *New* > *Folder*.
. In the text box labeled *Folder name*, type `lib`, then click *Finish*.
. Copy the three libraries — `sapjco3.jar`, `sapidoc3.jar` and the correct native library (if using CloudHub, use 64bit Linux) — to the `src/main/app` directory.

image::copylibs.png[]

== Running an SAP-Enabled Application Inside Studio

To run the application inside Studio, you must first add the three libraries to the project classpath. To do so, follow these steps:

. In the *Package Explorer* pane, right-click the project’s directory, then select *Properties*. (Alternatively, press `Alt-Enter` to open the *Properties* screen.
. In the *Properties* screen, select *Java Build Path* in the left pane, then click the *Libraries* tab.
+
image::props-for-sap-bapi-example.png[props.for.sap.bapi-example]

. Click *Add JARs*.

* In the *JAR Selection* pane, navigate to `src/main/app/lib`, which is the directory where you previously copied the SAP JCo libraries.
* Select the two files with a .jar extension (i.e., `libsapjco` and `sapjco3`), then click *OK*.
+
image::html-sapendpoint-simplestudioeditor-html-m3d9bc917.png[HTML-SAPEndpoint-SimpleStudioEditor_html_m3d9bc917]

[start=1]
. Verify that the two .jar files you just added now appear on the *Libraries* tab of the *Properties* screen.
. Click the arrow next to `sapjco3.jar` to expand it, then double-click **Native library location: (none)**.
. In the *Native Library Folder Configuration* dialog, complete the following sub steps:
.. click the *Workspace...* button on the right
.. navigate to the project’s `lib` folder
.. click *OK*. (Alternatively, type the location of the `lib` folder, such as `<Project name>/src/main/app/lib`).
+
image::html-sapendpoint-simplestudioeditor-html-11e4a294.png[HTML-SAPEndpoint-SimpleStudioEditor_html_11e4a294]

. Verify that your *Java Build Path* configuration resembles the following screenshot, then click *OK*.
+
image::java-build-path-with-libs.png[java.build.path-with.libs]

== Adding the SAP Transport to the Classpath

Specifying the location of the SAP transport in your system `classpath` enables you to run/debug your project locally and to create custom Java code in your project that uses the transport classes.

The SAP transport dependency gets added automatically when you drop any SAP building block to the canvas.

To add the SAP transport manually to the classpath, complete the following steps:

. Right-click on top of the projectin the Package Explorer pane.
. Select *Build Path* -> *Add Libraries ...*
. Select the library type *Mule Cloud Connectors Dependencies* and then click *Next*.
. On the *Extensions Classpath* list, check the SAP extension.

== Configuration

You can employ the SAP endpoint in any of the configurations listed below.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Configuration |Activity
|IDoc Inbound Endpoint |The SAP transport registers with a SAP server Gateway using a specific Program ID. This enables it to and receive iDocs sent to that destination.
|Function Inbound Endpoint |The SAP transport registers with a SAP server Gateway using a specific Program ID that allows the SAP transport to be called as a Function or BAPI using the RFC protocol drawn from ABAP code in SAP.
|IDoc Outbound Endpoint |The SAP transport sends an iDoc generated within Mule ESB to a SAP server.
|Function Outbound Endpoint |The SAP transport calls a Function or BAPI that resides on a SAP server.
|===

The SAP transport uses JCo as the underlying SAP integration technology. The Inbound Endpoints (both IDoc and Function) start a JCo server, while the Outbound Endpoints rely on the JCo client.

The connector allows both synchronous and asynchronous communications. By definition, functions are synchronous and IDocs are asynchronous.

* IDocs can be sent and received over tRFC and qRFC
* Functions (both inbound and outbound) allow sRFC, tRFC and qRFC

[TIP]
====
If the SAP Endpoint is configured as a function, the value of the *Function Name* property references different objects, depending on context:

* For inbound endpoints, *Function Name* is the name of the function that this server handles. If no value is provided, all functions will be handled.
* For outbound endpoints, *Function Name* is the name of the SAP object. If executing a function, this will be the name of the BAPI. This value is not required if the BAPI name is provided by the payload or nested element.
====

As from version 2.1.0, the SAP Outbound Endpoint can also be used to generate a template of a valid XML that represents a BAPI or an IDoc. In order to achieve this the type should be configured to *function-metadata* or *idoc-metadata* and the *Function Name* hold the name of the BAPI or IDoc.

== SAP Transformers

The SAP endpoints receive and transmit SAP objects, which must be transformed to and from XML within your Mule flow. MuleSoft bundles three SAP transformers specifically designed to handle such transformation:

* SAP Object to XML
* XML to SAP Function (BAPI)
* XML to SAP IDoc

These are available in the *Transformers* group on the Studio Palette. Entering *SAP* into the filter input box above the palette displays both the SAP Endpoint and the SAP Transformers (below):

image::sap-transformers-in-palette.png[SAP_transformers_in_palette]

Click and drag the *SAP Object to XML* transformer _after_ an SAP inbound endpoint (or a SAP outbound endpoint if the endpoint is a function and expects a response).

Click and drag the *XML to SAP Function (BAPI)* or the *XML to SAP IDoc* transformers _before_ your SAP outbound endpoint within your Mule application flow.

== SAP Inbound Endpoint Requirements

If you are configuring a SAP Inbound Endpoint (JCo Server), you must modify your OS `services` file, which is:

* `/etc/services` for a Unix-based OS
* `C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\services` for Windows

In the above file, you must add your gateway (which is configured through the `jcoGwService` attribute or the `jco.server.gwserv /jco.client.gwserv` property). Just add the gateway; you don’t need to add the entire service mapping list.

For example, to set the following, `jcoGwService=sapgw00`, add the following string:

[source,text,linenums]
----
bq. sapgw00 3300/tcp
----

Port 3300 is predefined by SAP.

== Connector Global Element

The SAP connector object holds the configuration properties that allow you to connect to the SAP server. When an SAP connector is defined as a *Global Element* all SAP endpoints use its connection parameters; otherwise each SAP endpoint uses its own connection parameters to connect to the SAP server.

To create an SAP connector, complete the following steps:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab below the *Message Flow* canvas.
. Click *Create*, then click the plus icon image:add.png[(plus)] to the left of Connectors.

. Select *SAP* from the drop-down list of available connectors, then click *OK*.
. In the *Global Elements Properties* pane, enter the required parameters for defining an SAP connection, which your SAP system administrator should supply.

=== Connection Properties

Many SAP connection properties exist. For ease of use, the SAP connector only shows the most common properties as connector parameters. To configure a property that is not listed in the Properties pane, consult <<Extended Properties>>.

image::sap-connector.png[]

At a minimum, provide values for the following attributes:

* In the *Name* field, enter an appropriate name for the Connector used by the SAP endpoints in your project.
* In the *AS Host* field, enter the name (URL or IP address) of the SAP system.
* In the *User* and *Password* fields, enter the username and password of a user authorized to connect to the SAP system.
* In the *SAP System Number* field, enter the system number used to connect to the SAP system.
* In the *SAP Client* field, enter the SAP client ID (usually a number) used to connect to the SAP system.
* In the *Login Language* field, enter the language that will be used in the SAP connection, for example *EN* for English.

=== Extended Properties

To provide additional configuration properties, you can define a Spring bean global element representing a Map (`java.util.Map`) instance. This can be used to configure, among other properties, SCN (Secure Connections), or advanced pooling capabilities.

In this case, you must know the configuration property _as defined by SAP_.

To define extended properties for the *SAP global connector*, complete the following steps:

. Navigate to the *Advanced* tab on the *Global Elements Properties* pane.
. Locate the *Extended Properties* section at the bottom of the window.
. Click the plus icon next to the *Extended Properties* drop-down menu to define additional configuration properties.

image::sap-connector-adv.png[]

== Prioritizing Connection Properties

Properties for SAP connections, both inbound and outbound, can be configured in numerous places, which may cause an overlap of connection parameters. The following list details the priorities accorded to values specified in different places, with the highest priority level listed first.

. Attributes defined at the *SAP Inbound Endpoint* and *SAP Outbound Endpoint* level, such as *User*, *Password*, *Gateway Host*, etc.
. Properties in the *Address* attribute at the *SAP Inbound Endpoint* and *SAP Outbound Endpoint* levels. (However, MuleSoft does not recommend using of the *Address* attribute for SAP connections.)
. Properties inside the Map configured in the *Extended Properties* pane for the JCo client or server at the *SAP Inbound Endpoint* and *SAP Outbound Endpoint* levels.
. Attributes configured at the *SAP Connector* level (i.e., *AS Host*, *User Password*, *SAP Client*, etc.).
. Properties inside the Map configured in the *Extended Properties* pane at the *SAP Connector* level.
. Default values.

== XML Definition

The definition provided below is the XML representation of a function (JCOFunction) or IDoc (IDocDocument /IDocDocumentList). These are the XML documents you exchange with SAP.

The SAP transport bundles <<SAP Transformers>> that convert the XML documents exchanged between the endpoints and SAP into corresponding SAP objects that the endpoints can handle.

== Inbound Endpoint

An Inbound Endpoint receives IDocs and Functions over RFC. To implement a *SAP Inbound Endpoint*, complete the following steps:

. Drag and drop the *SAP Endpoint* from the Endpoints group on the palette to the beginning of your flow.
. Double-click the SAP icon to open the *Endpoint Properties* pane, then define your endpoint's properties.
. In the *Type* drop-down menu, select whether to receive IDocs or Function calls.
+
image::sap-endpoint-type.png[]

[NOTE]
After selecting the Endpoint type, the *Endpoint Properties* editor will automatically enable or disable parameter input boxes according to the selected endpoint type. For example, after selecting *IDoc* as the Endpoint Type, function-related parameters such as the *Function Name* input box or the *Evaluate Function Response* checkbox will be disabled.

[WARNING]
Since the JCo server needs to register with the SAP instance, you must specify _both_ the *client* and *server* configuration attributes.

=== Inbound Endpoint Properties

The following table lists *Inbound Endpoint* properties.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property Name |Mule Attribute Name |Endpoint Properties Tab |Description |Default Value
|Display Name |name |General |The reference name of the endpoint used internally by Mule configuration. |
|All Exchange Patterns |exchange-pattern |General |The available options are request-response and one-way. |

=== IDoc Endpoint Properties

To configure an IDoc Server, complete the following steps.

. Starting from the *General* tab of the SAP Endpoint *Properties* pane, set the *Type* property to *IDoc*.
. Define the *RFC Type* parameter as *Transactional RFC (tRFC)* or **Queued RFC (qRFC)**. IDocs are asynchronous by definition, so they cannot be received over **Synchronous RFC (sRFC)**.
. <<Configuring the TID Handler>>. The default is an in-memory TID handler.
. Specify the following required attributes:
* Gateway Host
* Gateway Service
* Program ID
. Click the *Advanced* tab, then specify the required connection attributes, as necessary, for the endpoint or the connector. This might include, for example, *SAP Client*, *User*, *Password*, *AS Host* and *SAP System Number*.

=== Function Endpoint Properties

To configure the Endpoint as an RFC Server, complete the following steps.

. Set the *type* parameter to `function`.
. Define the *rfcType* parameter to `trfc`, `qrfc` or `srfc`. If *rfcType* is not specified, `srfc` is used by default.
. When *rfcType* is `trfc` or `qrfc`, you may also need to <<Configuring the TID Handler>>.
. Specify the following required attributes: *jcoGwHost*, *jcoGwService*, *jcoProgramId*.
. Specify the required connection attributes, as necessary, for the endpoint or the connector. This might include, for example, *jcoClient*, *jcoUser*, *jcoPasswd*, *jcoAsHost*, *jcoSysnr*.
. In the *General* tab, set the *Type* property to `Function (BAPI)`.
. Define the *RFC Type* parameter as `Transactional RFC (tRFC)`, `Queued RFC (qRFC)` or `Synchronous RFC (sRFC)`.
. If the *RFC Type* is either `Transactional RFC (tRFC)` or `Queued RFC (qRFC)`, then <<Configuring the TID Handler>>.
. Specify the following required attributes:
* *Gateway Host*
* *Gateway Service*
* *Program ID*
. In the *Advanced* tab, specify the required connection attributes, as necessary, for the endpoint or the connector. This might include, for example, *SAP Client*, *User*, *Password*, *AS Host* and *SAP System Number*.

=== Configuring the TID Handler

The TID handler (Transaction ID) is an important component for *tRFC* and *qRFC*, ensuring that Mule ESB does not process the same transaction twice.

To define the TID handler, complete the following steps.

. In the *General* tab of the *Endpoint Properties* window, locate the *TID Store* section near the bottom of the window.
. From the *Type* drop-down menu, select one of the three options for the TID handler:
* *None*: No TID handler.
* *Default In Memory TID Store*: facilitates the sharing of TIDs within the same Mule ESB instance. If the Endpoint *Type* is `tRFC` or `qRFC`, and no TID store is configured, then this default store is used.
* *Object Store TID Store*: This wrapper uses existing Mule ESB object stores to store and share TIDs. If you need multiple Mule ESB server instances, you should configure a JDBC Object Store so that you can share TIDs among the instances.

[NOTE]
When the Endpoint *Type* is set to **Synchronous RFC (sRFC)**, or it is not provided (thus defaulting to *Synchronous RFC*), then no TID handler is configured. Furthermore, if a TID handler has been configured in the XML file, it will be ignored.

To configure an **In-memory TID Store**, you must observe the following:

* the In-memory TID Store won't work as expected if you have multiple Mule ESB instances that share the same *program id*. (This is because the SAP gateway load-balances across all registered SAP servers that share the same *program id*)
* the Endpoint *Type* should be *trfc* or *qrfc*
* configuring the child element `<sap:default-in-memory-tid-store/>` is optional, since the in-memory handler is the default option

=== References

If you already created the global connector (see <<Connector Global Element>>), then select it here. If not, you can create your SAP connector here.

=== Advanced

[IMPORTANT]
====
The address attribute is supported by the SAP connector for compatibility with other Mule ESB endpoints.

MuleSoft recommends that you do not configure this attribute for the SAP connector.
====

You can override all *Connector* properties by including a new reference to an *Extended Properties* map.

=== Server Extended Properties

When configuring the Inbound Endpoint, you may also provide specific server configuration advanced properties.

== Outbound Endpoint

An *Outbound Endpoint* executes functions (BAPIs), or it sends IDocs over RFC. Properties for an outbound endpoint resemble those of an inbound endpoint, and you configure them through the *Endpoint Properties* pane.

In an Outbound Endpoint, the IDoc or Function can be built in one of two ways:

* defined as the endpoint's payload
* obtained from an XML file

To manually define the IDoc or Function, complete the following steps.

. Navigate to the *XML Definition* tab within the *Endpoint Properties* pane.
. Type or copy and paste the IDoc or Function into the input box below the *Function / IDoc XML* checkbox.

To obtain the IDoc or Function from an XML file, click *Definition File*, and do one of the following:

* type the full path to the file
* click *...* (i.e., the ellipsis button) to navigate to the file

If you neither define the payload, nor specify a definition file, Mule builds the payload by applying a default template to the data received by the endpoint.

=== Outbound Endpoint Properties

The following table lists *Outbound Endpoint* properties:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property Name |Mule Attribute Name |Endpoint Properties Tab |Description |Default Value
|Display Name |name |General |The reference name of the endpoint used internally by Mule configuration. |
|All Exchange Patterns |exchange-pattern |General |The available options are request-response and one-way. |
|Address |address |Advanced |The standard way to provide endpoint properties. For more information check: Endpoint Address. |
|Type |type |General |The type of SAP object this endpoint will process (i.e., *function* or *idoc*) Starting in 2.1.0 *function-metadata* and *idoc-metadata* can be used to retrieved XML structure for a given BAPI or IDoc. |function
|RFC Type |rfcType |General |The type of RFC the endpoint used to receive a function or IDoc. The available options are *srfc* (which is *sync* with *no TID handler*), *trfc* and *qrfc* (both of which are *async*, with a *TID handler*). |srfc
|Queue Name |queueName |General |If the RFC type is *qrfc*, then this will be the name of the queue. |
|Function Name |functionName |General |If the type is *function* then this is the name of the BAPI function that will be executed. When a metadata type is selected then this attribute holds the name of the BAPI or IDoc whose metadata should be retrieved. |
|XML Version |xmlVersion |General |When type is one of metadata types, then the version of the XML to generate (There are two possible XML versions for functions) | Version 1
|Evaluate Function Response (checkbox) |evaluateFunctionResponse |General |When the type is *function*, a *true* flag (i.e., box checked) indicates that the SAP transport should evaluate the function response and throw an exception when an error occurs in SAP. When this flag is set to *false* (box unchecked), the SAP transport does not throw an exception when an error occurs, and the user is responsible for parsing the function response. |false
|Is BAPI Transaction (checkbox) |bapiTransaction |General |When checked, either *BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT* or *BAPI_TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK* is called at the end of the transaction, depending on the result of that transaction. | false
|Definition File |definitionFile |XML Definition |THe path to the template definition file of either the function to be executed or the IDoc to be sent. |
|IDoc Version |idocVersion |Advanced |When the type is *idoc*, this version is used when sending the IDoc. Values for the IDoc version correspond to *IDOC_VERSION_xxxx* constants in com.sap.conn.idoc.IDocFactory |0 (IDOC_VERSION_DEFAULT).
|SAP Client |jcoClient |Advanced |The SAP client. This is usually an integer, such as 100 |
|User |jcoUser |Advanced |The logon user for password-based authentication |
|Password |jcoPasswd |Advanced |The logon password associated with the logon user for password based authentication. |
|Login Language |jcoLang |Advanced |The login language. If not defined, the default user language is used. |en
|AS Host |jcoAsHost |Advanced |The SAP application server host. Use either the IP address or server name. |
|SAP System Number |jcoSysnr |Advanced |The SAP system number. |
|Pool Capacity |jcoPoolCapacity |Advanced |The maximum number of idle connections kept open by the destination. No connection pooling takes place when the value is 0. |5
|Peak Limit |jcoPeakLimit |The maximum number of simultaneously active connections that can be created for a destination. |10 |
|Extended Properties |jcoClientExtendedProperties-ref |Advanced |A Reference to `java.util.Map`, which contains additional JCo connection parameters.|
|===

=== Transactions

While the SAP outbound endpoint supports *Transactions*, distributed transactions are _not_ supported, since the JCo libraries do not support XA.

To define transaction attributes, navigate to the *General* tab of the *Endpoint Properties* pane, then locate the *Transaction* section near the bottom of the window.

The following table lists transaction attributes:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property Name |Mule Attribute |Description |Default |Value
|ACTION |action |The action attribute is part of the Mule ESB transaction standard and can have the following values: NONE, ALWAYS_BEGIN, BEGIN_OR_JOIN, ALWAYS_JOIN and JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE |
|===

Since version 2.1.0 is BAPI transaction attribute can be found in Client Settings pane in General options tab.
