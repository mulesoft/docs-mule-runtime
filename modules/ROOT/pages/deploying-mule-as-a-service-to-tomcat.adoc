This page describes two activities that will enable you to deploy your Mule applications on Tomcat Web server:

* Install Mule as a service on a Apache Tomcat server
* Set up your Mule applications for hot deployment

For more information on hot deploying Mule applications, see xref:application-server-based-hot-deployment.adoc[Application Server Based Hot Deployment].

== Installing Mule on Tomcat

. http://tomcat.apache.org/[Download] and install Apache Tomcat, following Apache's installation instructions.
. In the Tomcat home directory on your system, add the following line to the `conf/server.xml` file:
+
`<Listener className="org.mule.config.builders.MuleXmlBuilderContextListener" />`

. If you have not already done so, create a Tomcat home directory on your local system.
. Copy the contents of the Mule `lib` folder with all its subdirectories - *except* `/boot` to the `mule-libs/` - to your Tomcat home directory. You do not need to flatten the directories.
. Copy the `mule-module-tomcat-<version>.jar` file to the `mule-lib/mule/` directory in your Tomcat home directory.
. Copy the following libraries from your Mule `lib/boot/` directory to your Tomcat `mule-libs/opt/` directory:
+
* commons-cli-1.2.jar
* jul-to-slf4j-1.6.1.jar
* log4j-1.2.16.jar
* mule-module-logging-3.3.1.jar
* wrapper-3.5.7.jar

. In the Tomcat `conf/catalina.properties` file, add the following to `common.loader` (preceded by a comma to separate it from existing values:)
+
`${catalina.home}/mule-libs/user/*.jar,${catalina.home}/mule-libs/mule/*.jar,${catalina.home}/mule-libs/opt/*.jar`

== Deploying Mule Applications in Tomcat

. Package your Mule application's configuration file and custom Java classes in `.war` file (see xref:application-server-based-hot-deployment.adoc[Application Server Based Hot Deployment]).
. Copy your application's `.war` file, then paste it in the Tomcat `/webapps` directory.
. Tomcat hot deploys the application.

If you need to make a change to the configuration or Java file in the Mule application, modify the file in the expanded directory under the Tomcat `/webapps` directory, then touch the `web.xml` file (for example, simply add and delete a space in the file and then save it). These actions trigger Tomcat to redeploy the application.

Alternatively, you can modify the application's source files repackage them as a `.war` file, then drop the new `.war` file into the `/webapps` directory to trigger Tomcat to redeploy the application.
