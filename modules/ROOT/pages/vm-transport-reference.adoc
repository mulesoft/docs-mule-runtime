The VM transport can be used for intra-JVM communication between Mule xref:flows-and-subflows.adoc[flows]. This transport by default uses in-memory queues but can optionally be configured to use persistent queues. (Note, however, that VM file persistency does not work on clusters.)

[NOTE]
Note that VM queue persistence behaves differently on CloudHub. See the https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/cloudhub-fabric[CloudHub Fabric] documentation for more details.

== Transformers

There are no specific transformers for the VM transport.

== Considerations

The VM transport has often been used to implement complex integrations made up of multiple applications. Improvements in Mule 3 obviate the need for VM in many cases. You can use xref:flow-ref-component-reference.adoc[Flow References] to directly reference one flow from another without a transport in the middle.

VM is still useful in certain situations. Suppose, for instance, that most of the parts of your solution are local, but some needs to be decoupled for testing, or because some needs to be made remote.

[WARNING]
====
*WARNING*

Each application in a Mule instance has its own, unique set of VM endpoints. Thus the VM transport cannot be used to communicate between different Mule applications.
====

== Features

The in memory (VM) transport has two modes of operation: One for use with _request-response_ and another for use with _one-way_ endpoints.

*_request-response:_*

When using _request-response_ endpoints, messages are delivered directly from an outbound vm endpoint to the inbound vm endpoint that is listening on the same path. This delivery is blocking and occurs in the same thread. If there is no inbound _request-response_ VM endpoint in the same Mule application listening on this path, then dispatching of the message from the outbound endpoint fails.

*_one-way:_*

When using _one-way_ endpoints, messages are delivered to the corresponding inbound endpoint via a queue. This delivery is non-blocking. If there is no inbound _one-way_ endpoint in the same Mule application listening on this path, then, although dispatching of the message succeeds, the message remains in the queue. By default, this queue is in memory, but it is also possible to configure a persistent queue that uses the file system as its persistence mechanism.

== Usage

To use VM endpoints, follow these three steps. Each of these steps is explained in further detail, below.

. Add the MULE VM namespace to your configuration:
* Define the vm prefix using `xmlns:vm="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/vm"
* Define the schema location with +http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/vm+ +http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/vm/3.4/mule-vm.xsd+
. Optionally, define one or more connectors for VM endpoints.
* Create a VM connector:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<vm:connector name="vmConnector"/>
----
+
If none is created, all VM endpoints use a default connector.

. Create VM endpoints.
* Messages are received on inbound endpoints.
* Messages are sent to outbound endpoints.
* Both kinds of endpoints are identified by a path name or address.

=== Declaring the VM Namespace

To use the VM transport, you must declare the VM namespace in the header of the Mule configuration file. For example:

[%header,cols="1*a"]
|===
^|VM Transport Namespace Declaration
|
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:vm="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/vm"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/3.4/mule.xsd
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/vm http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/vm/3.4/mule-vm.xsd">
----

=== Configuring VM Connectors

The configuration of the VM connector is optional. Configuring a connector allows you to configure a Queue Profile.

==== How Queues are Used in VM Transports

By default, Mule uses queues in the asynchronous processing of messages that use the VM transport. The VM transport can be used for flows, where all the message processing is done in the JVM in which the Mule instance is running.

When requests come into a receiver for a flow that uses the VM transport, they are stored on a queue until threads from a thread pool can pick them up and process them. The receiver thread is then released back into the receiver thread pool so it can carry another incoming message. Each message waiting in the queue can be assigned a different thread from the pool of threads.

You configure a queue for a VM transport through a queue profile. The queue profile specifies how the queue behaves. Typically, you do not need to configure the queue profile for performance, since the default configuration is usually sufficient, that is, the queue is not the bottleneck. (Performance is usually limited by the component or one of the endpoints). For other reasons, you still might want to specify a maximum queue size, or enable persistence on the queue (which is disabled by default).

You configure the queue profile using the <queue-profile> element. For a VM transport, you specify the <queue-profile> element on the connector.

Here are the attributes of the <queue-profile> element:

[%header,cols="25,10,10,10,40"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|`maxOutstandingMessages` |integer |no |0 |Defines the maximum number of messages that can be queued. The default, 0, means there is no limit on the number of messages that can be queued.
|`persistent` |boolean |no |false |Specifies whether Mule messages are persisted to a store. Primarily, this is used for persisting queued messages to disk so that the internal state of the server is mirrored on disk in case the server fails and needs to be restarted.
|===

Based on the persistent attribute value you specify, Mule chooses a persistence strategy to use for the queue. By default, Mule use two persistence strategies:

* `MemoryPersistenceStrategy`, which is a volatile, in-memory persistence strategy.
* `FilePersistenceStrategy`, which uses a file store to persist messages to a (non-volatile) disk, and therefore maintains messages even if Mule is restarted.

=== Configuring Endpoints

Endpoints are configured as with all transports.

The VM transport specific endpoints are configured using the vm namespace and use a _path_ or _address_ attribute. For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<vm:outbound-endpoint path="out" exchange-pattern="one-way"/>
----

If you need to invoke a VM endpoint from Mule client, use an endpoint URI. The format of an endpoint uri for VM is as follows:

[source,text,linenums]
----
vm://<your_path_here>
----

== Using Transactions

_One-way_ VM queues can take part in distributed xref:xa-transactions.adoc[XA Transactions]. To make a VM endpoint transactional, use a configuration like the following:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow>
  <vm:inbound-endpoint address="vm://dispatchInQueue">
    <vm:transaction action="BEGIN_OR_JOIN"/>
  </vm:inbound-endpoint>
</flow>
----

Using XA requires that you add a transaction manager to your configuration. For more information, see xref:transaction-management.adoc[Transaction Management].

=== Transactional Inbound VM Queues

Inbound VM endpoints support fully transactional flows. For instance, the following configuration creates a VM queue (because the inbound endpoint is one-way), and process messages read from this queue synchronously and transactionally:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="transactionalVM">
    <vm:inbound-endpoint path="orders" exchange-pattern="one-way">
        <vm:transaction action="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
    </vm:inbound-endpoint>
    <component class="com/mycompany.ProcessOrder"/>
</flow>
----

XA transactions are also supported:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="transactionalVM">
    <vm:inbound-endpoint path="orders" exchange-pattern="one-way">
        <xa-transaction action="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>
    </vm:inbound-endpoint>
    <component class="com/mycompany.ProcessOrder"/>
    <jms:outbound-endpoint ref="processedOrders">
        <xa-transaction action="ALWAYS_JOIN"/>
    </jms:outbound-endpoint>
</flow>
----

== Example Configurations

[%header,cols="1*a"]
|===
^|Example usage of VM endpoints
|
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<vm:connector name="persistentVmConnector" queueTimeout="1000"> ❶
   <queue-profile maxOutstandingMessages="100" persistent="true"/>
</vm:connector>

<flow>
    <vm:inbound-endpoint path="in" exchange-pattern="request-response"/> ❷
    <component class="org.mule.ComponentClass"/>
    <vm:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="out" connector-ref="persistentVmConnector" /> ❸
</flow>
----
|===

The first vm endpoint ❷ (inbound) uses a _request-response_ exchange pattern and the default connector configuration, thus no connector definition is needed. +
The second vm endpoint ❸ (outbound) uses a _one-way_ exchange pattern and a customized connector configuration ❶ with a queue profile and queueTimeout.
