== To Determine Which Version of Mule You Are Running

If you already have Mule installed, you can follow these steps in Anypoint Studio or Mule Standalone to determine the version number of your Mule runtime.

=== Use Anypoint Studio

This procedure assumes that you have launched Studio and that you have opened a new or existing project. If you have not yet opened your first project in Studio, click File > New > Mule Project, and observe the default value in the *Server Runtime* field in the wizard.

To view the Studio version, right-click the project name in Package Explorer. The version appears next to the mule-project.xml file name. You can also double-click the mule-project.xml file name and view the version in the Server Runtime field:

=== Use Mule Standalone
