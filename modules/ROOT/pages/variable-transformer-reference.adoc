The Set Variable (`set-variable`) component is for creating or updating a variable to store values for use within the flow of a Mule app. You can store simple literal values such as strings or messages, message payloads, or attribute objects. For example, you might store the original payload of a message (before it is processed) so you can use it later in the flow or within an error handler.

The `set-variable` component is not recommended for complex expressions or transformations. You should instead use it for simple ones, such as selections, and use the xref:transform-component-about.adoc[Transform Component]
for complex scenarios.

|===
|Field | Usage | Description

| Variable Name (`variableName`)
| Required
| Name of the variable. Names can only include numbers, characters, and underscores. For example, hyphens are not allowed in the name.

| Value (`value`)
| Required
| Value for the variable, which can be a string or a DataWeave expression.

| Mime Type (`mimeType`)
| Optional
| Sets the variable MIME type, such as `text/plain` or `application/json`.

| Encoding (`encoding`)
| Optional
| Sets the variable encoding, such as `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

|===

[WARNING]
--
The `mimeType` and `encoding` attributes do not affect a DataWeave expression used as `value`. They only affect the output value stored. If a transformation is required, the DataWeave expression must contain an explicit output directive.

== Examples

This example sets the variable to a string:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `my first variable`

This example sets the variable by using a DataWeave operation that results in a value of `5`:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `#[max([1,2,3] ++ [3,4,5])]` in Anypoint Studio.

This example sets the variable to the message payload:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `payload` in Design Center, `#[payload]` in Anypoint Studio.

This example sets the variable to the message attributes:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `attributes` in Design Center, `#[attributes]` in Anypoint Studio.

This example sets the variable to the entire message:

* Name = `myVar`
* Value = `message` in Design Center, `#[message]` in Anypoint Studio.

This XML example sets a variable that takes a map as a value:
`<set-variable variableName="employee" value="{ 'name' : 'Ana', 'office' : 'BA' }" mimeType="application/json" encoding="UTF-8/>`

This example sets the same variable using selectors in a DataWeave script. It assumes the `name` attribute is available as input to Set Variable:
`<set-variable variableName="employee" value="#[output application/java --- payload.name]"/>`


== Accessing Variables in Other Event Processors
Set Variable sets a variable in the current Mule event, and the variables then travel with the Mule event to downstream event processors. You can access any variable with DataWeave using `vars`. So if you set a variable named lastMessage, you can access it as `vars.lastMessage`.  You can set variables in a Transform Message component, and also many connectors and event processors have a Target that can be set in the Advanced tab. These all set flow variables and they are accessed the same way, through the keyword `vars.`.
