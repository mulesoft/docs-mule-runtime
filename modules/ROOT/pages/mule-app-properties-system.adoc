You can use system properties to specify or override property placeholder values that a connector or component in a Mule app uses. MuleSoft recommends this practice when you are deploying your app to a new environment and need to override values in configuration property files for your Mule app.

You can manage system properties in these ways:

* From Anypoint Studio through the Run Configurations window for the project.
* From the command line for a standalone Mule instance.

== Set System Properties in Anypoint Studio

You can add properties when you launch your project through the Package Explorer in Studio:

. Right-click the project for your Mule app in Package Explorer.
. Click Run As -> Run Configurations.
. Pick the Arguments tab.
. Add your arguments to the VM Arguments field, prepending the property names with `-D`

When you deploy your app through Studio, the new values for property placeholders will take precedence over other values set for those placeholders:

`<logger message="${propertyFromJVMArg}" doc:name="System Property Set in Studio through JVM args"/>`

== Set Placeholder Values from JDK System Properties

For the Mule standalone, you can set and change property placeholder values through a JDK system property from the command line, for example:

`mule -M-Dsmtp.username=JSmith -M-Dsmtp.password=ChangeMe`
