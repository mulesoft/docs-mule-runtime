Use a *session variable* to set or remove a variable that is tied to a message for its entire lifecycle, potentially across multiple flows, applications, and even servers. Session variables can be easily propagated from one flow to another through the VM transport, or a flow reference, but not through the xref:http-connector.adoc[HTTP Connector]. By contrast, variables specified through the xref:variable-transformer-reference.adoc[variable transformer] persist only as long as the message with which they are associated remains within the same flow. To learn more about message scopes, refer to xref:mule-concepts.adoc[Mule Concepts].

*<<Complete Code Example>>*

The session variable transformer differs from the variable transformer and the property transformer. See the table below for a comparison of these three transformers.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|  |Session Variable Transformer |Variable Transformer |Property Transformer
|*Use* |Use to set or remove a variable that is tied to the current message for its entire lifecycle, across multiple flows, applications, and even servers. |Use to set or remove a variable on the message, tied to the current flow. |Use to set, remove, or copy properties on the outbound scope of a message.
|*Persistence* |Session variables set with a session variable transformer persist for the entire message lifecycle, regardless of transport barriers, except for the xref:http-connector.adoc[HTTP Connector] which doesn't propagate them. |Variables set with a variable transformer persist only for the current flow and cannot cross the transport barrier. |Once a message hits an outbound-connector, all properties in the outbound scope are sent with the message in the form of transport-specific metadata ( HTTP headers for an HTTP outbound-connector, for example).
|===

Once you have set a session variable, you can invoke it using the *`sessionVars`* map in a Mule expression. For example, if you have set a session variable with the name "`SVname`" and the value "`SVvalue`", you can later invoke that session variable using the expression `#[sessionVars.SVname]`, which evaluates to `SVvalue`.

[WARNING]
Note that the session variable is linked to a Mule Message, but not to a MuleEvent. This means that if you make use of an element that makes copies of the message – such as an xref:async-scope-reference.adoc[async scope] or a xref:scatter-gather.adoc[scatter gather component] – changes in flow variables won't be persisted in between these replicated messages, even though they started as one.

|*doc:name* a|
Customize to display a unique name for the transformer in your application.

Note: Attribute not required in Mule Standalone configuration.

|*variableName* a|
The name of the session variable that you are setting or removing. Can be a string or a Mule expression.

Note: If you are using the remove-session-variable element, you may use a wildcard "*" character. For example, a remove-session-variable transformer with the element `variableName="http.*"` will remove all variables whose names begin with "http." from the message.

|*value* |The value of the session variable that you are setting. This attribute is only relevant for the set-session-variable element. Can be a string or a Mule expression.

== Example

In many cases, messages travel across multiple flows, applications and even servers. In such cases, it can be useful to attach some kind of metadata to a message so as to track it from its origin to its final destination across all systems. In the example below, we set a session variable named messageID. This messageID contains a unique identifier that persists on the message over its entire lifecycle (unless it is explicitly removed by another session variable transformer).
