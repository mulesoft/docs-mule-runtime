= Configuring Mule Stacktraces
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

By default Mule will filter out some internal class references from stacktraces to produce a more readable output. This behavior can be controlled one of three ways:

* Command-line arguments
* Setting properties in Mule Studio
* Using JMX

== Command-Line Arguments

Two command-line properties enable you to control this behavior using `-M-DpropertyName:`

* `mule.stacktrace.full` - when present, Mule will not filter stacktraces. Intended for Mule developers only, end user would probably never need to enable this.

* `mule.stacktrace.filter` - a comma-seperated list of packages and/or classes to remove from the stacktraces (matched via `string.startsWith() )`)

== Setting Properties in Mule Studio

In Studio, you can set the same properties specified above to instruct Mule to provide either unfiltered stacktraces or to configure a particular filter of packages or classes that should be removed. To adjust these settings, open your mule-project.xml file and define environment variables to specify the behavior you want. In the example below, the *`mule.stacktrace.full`* property is set to *true*.

== Using JMX

The Configuration MBean now exposes two new options.

* FullStackTrace - same as above
* StackTraceFilter - same as above

Note that these settings are shared between apps even though each app has its own Configuration MBean. That means that modifying it in one app will affect others.
