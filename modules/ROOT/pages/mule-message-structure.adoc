// [NOTE]
// This document examines the Mule message in the context of a *flow* rather than a *batch job*. Please see xref:3.8@mule-runtime::batch-processing.adoc[Batch Processing] for more information about how messages in a batch job are broken up and processed as *records*.

The *Mule message* is the data that passes through flows inside your Mule application.

It consists of two main parts:

* The message *attributes*, which contains metadata from and attributes of the Mule message.
* The message *payload*, which contains the core information of the Mule message.

== Attributes

The metadata contained in the message header consists of *attributes* which provide process related information about the message.

Each individual attribute has a *name* and a *value*. The name is how you refer to the attribute, and the value is the information stored within it.


//TODO: Add examples on how to access the Attributes within the message
// === Setting and Using Attributes and Variables



== Message Payload

The message payload is the most important part of the Mule message because it contains the data your Mule application processes. You may apply metadata in the message header to communicate information about your message or secure it from being tampered with, but the core of the message – the data you are transporting – is the reason the message exists in the first place.

// REVIEW: Payload (as the message) is immutable. Each processor returns a new payload.
// The payload doesn't necessarily stay the same as it travels through a flow. Various message processors in a Mule flow can affect the payload along the way by setting it, enriching, or transforming it into a new format. You can also extract information from a payload within a flow using a MEL expression.

Each Event Processor that receives a Mule Event, returns a new Mule Message. Meaning that each Event Processor returns a new payload.

// === Setting a Message Payload
//
// Use a *Set Payload* event processor to completely replace the content of the message's payload. Enter a literal string or a Data Weave expression that defines the new payload that Mule should set. The following example replaces the payload with a string that reads "Hello, my friend!".

// === Enriching a Message Payload
//
// In some cases, you may wish to call an external resource and use the response to enrich the message payload, rather than replace it. To do so, you can use a *Message Enricher* scope (or wrapper) to encapsulate one or more event processors which perform the task of fetching the information. Once obtained, Mule adds to, or enriches, the message payload with the result of the call to the resource.

// == Viewing the Mule Message
//
// In Studio, you can visualize the structure of a Mule Message at any given point of the flow. All you have to do is select an element in the flow and  click the *DataSense* icon.
//
// image:datasenseexplorericon.png[icon]
//
// This opens the *DataSense explorer*, and displays both the structure of the message that enters the element, and the structure of the message that leaves it. This is useful to know the names of variables and attributes that are available at that point, as well as the payload's internal structure.
//
// image:metadata-explorer.png[metadata]
//
// [TIP]
// When the Mule Message relies on inbound requests, information about the initial message structure won't be known by Studio and so won't be displayed in the DataSense explorer. If you know what the structure needs to be like, you can input this information into the *Metadata* tab of the inbound connector. Thanks to that, the DataSense explorer infers the message structure for any of the elements that follow that input.
