[[unzip1]]
== unzip(Array<Array<T>>): Array<Array<T>>

Performs the opposite of `zip`.


Given a single array where each index contains an array with two elements,
`unzip` outputs two separate arrays, each with the corresponding elements
of each pair. If the indices in the provided array contain arrays with more
than two elements, the output contains as many arrays as there are
elements for each index.

=== Example

This example unzips an array of arrays. Note that in example `b`, the number
of elements in input array is not consistent. So the function only creates
as many full arrays as it can, in this case just one.
