*_Enterprise, CloudHub_*

The *Cache Scope* saves on time and processing load by storing and reusing frequently called data. You can put any number of message processors into a cache scope and configure the caching strategy to store the responses (which contain the payload of the response message) produced by the processing that occurs within the scope. Mule's default caching strategy defines how data are stored and reused, but if you want to adjust cache behavior, you can customize a global caching strategy in Mule and make it available for use by all cache scopes in your application.

Mule sends a message into the cache scope and the parent flow expects and output. The cache scope processes the message, delivers the output to the parent flow and saves the output (i.e. caches the response). The next time Mule sends the same kind of message into the cache scope, the cache scope may offer a cached response rather than invoking, again, a potentially time-consuming process.

[NOTE]
You can configure the exchange patterns of endpoints in a cache scope to operate as *request-response* or *one-way*. Regardless of exchange pattern settings or any data retrieval activity that might occur within it, the cache scope simply caches the output of the flow inside it; when a message next enters the scope, the cache scope offers the cached output, or *cached response*.

You can use cache scope to reduce the processing load on the Mule instance and speed up message processing within a flow. It is particularly effective for:

* Processing repeated requests for the same information
* Processing requests for information that involve large, non-consumable message payloads

For instance, you can use a cache scope to manage customer requests for flight information. Many customers may request the same pricing information about flights from San Francisco to Buenos Aires. Rather than using a lot of processing power to send separate requests to several airline databases with each customer query, you can use a cache scope to arrange to send a request to the databases fewer times - say, once every ten minutes - and present users with the cached flight pricing information. Where timeliness of data is not critical, cache scope can save time and processing power.

== Caching Strategy

The *caching strategy* defines the actions a cache scope takes when a message enters its subflow.

* If there _is no_ cached response event (a cache "miss"), cache scope processes the message.
* If there _is_ a cached response event (a cache "hit"), cache scope offers the cached response event rather than processing the message.

You can customize a global caching strategy in Mule for the cache scopes in your application to flow, or you can use Mule's default caching strategy.

=== Default Caching Strategy

By default, all cache scopes in Mule applications follow the caching strategy procedure described below. Consult the xref:cache-scope.adoc[Creating a Global Caching Strategy] section below if you want to create your own custom global caching strategy.

. A message enters the cache scope.
. Cache scope determines whether the message's payload is consumable. A *consumable payload* can only be read once before it is lost - such as a streaming payload - and cannot be cached.
** If the message payload _is_ consumable, cache scope always processes the message; nothing is cached and the caching strategy is abandoned.
** If the message payload _is not_ consumable, cache scope continues to the next step in the caching strategy.
. Cache scope generates a key to identify the message's payload. Mule uses an MD5KeyGenerator and an MD5 digest to generate a unique key for the message payload.
. Cache scope compares the newly-generated key to cache responses that it has previously processed and saved in an InMemoryObjectStore - a container for cached data. In other words, cache scope searches for a "cache hit" it can offer instead of processing the message.
** Where there is a _cache miss_, cache scope processes the new message and produces a response. Cache scope also saves the resulting response in the object store. (If the response has a consumable payload, it does not cache the response).
** Where there is a _cache hit_, the caching strategy uses a DefaultResponseGenerator to generate a response that combines data from both the new request and the cached response. (If generated response has a consumable payload, it does not cache the response.)
. Cache scope pushes the response out into the parent flow for continued processing.

== Creating a Global Caching Strategy

Create a global caching strategy to customize some of the activities that your cache scopes perform.

For example, a cache scope that processes messages with large payloads - which, in turn, results in large cached responses in the InMemoryObjectStore - may quickly exhaust memory storage and slow the processing performance of your flow. In such a case, you may wish to create a global caching strategy that stores cached responses in a different type of object store and prevents memory exhaustion.

|Directory |*directory* |Enter the file path of the file where object store saves cached responses.

== Example

The example that follows demonstrates the power of the cache scope with a Fibonacci function. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which the next number in the series is always the sum of the two number preceding it.

In this example, the Mule flow receives and performs two tasks for each request:

. Executes, and returns the answer to, the Fibonacci equation (see below) using a number _(n)_ provided by the caller `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1`

. Records and returns the cost of the calculation, wherein each individual invocation of a calculation task (i.e. add two numbers in the sequence) adds 1 to the cost

If a call to the Fibonacci function has already been calculated and cached, the flow returns both the cached response and the cost of retrieving the cached response, which is 0. To demonstrate the number of invocations cache spares the function, this example includes the ability to force the flow to perform the full calculation by adding a nocache parameter to the request URL.

The following sequence illustrates a series of calls to the Fibonacci function. Notice that when the flow is able to return a cached value — because it has already performed an identical calculation — the cost returned is 0. When the flow is able to respond with a value it has calculated using another cached response (as in request-response C, below), the cost represents the difference between the cached response and the new request. (For example, if the Fibonacci function has already calculated and cached a request for n=10, and then receives a request for n=13, the cost to return the second response is 3.)

As this example illustrates, cache saves both time and processing load by reusing data it has already retrieved or calculated.
