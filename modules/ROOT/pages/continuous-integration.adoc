With all the previous emphasis on testing, setting up continuous integration for your project should be very easy. By using Maven as your build tool, you'll be able to set-up a build that gets triggered on every project change and run all its unit and functional tests automatically.

There are plenty of continuous integration tools out there. To name a few: Hudson, TeamCity and Bamboo are popular choices.

If you've opted for using real transports in your functional test cases, you will have to pay attention to potential port conflicts that could occur in your continuous build server.

If your target deployable is a web application and not a Mule application, consider using Junit Integration Test Runner for running your functional tests and avoiding port conflicts.
