= Back-Pressure and MaxConcurrency

Under heavy load, Mule runtime engine (Mule) might not immediately have the resources available to process a specific event. This issue might occur because all threads are busy and the current flow’s concurrency is exceeded. When this occurs, Mule logs the following message:
`Flow 'flowName' is unable to accept new events at this time` +
This message is known as back-pressure. Mule back-pressure actions are specific to each connector’s source.

When a producer component outputs information at a higher rate than a consumer component can process it, you can use the `maxConcurrency` parameter to set the maximum number of concurrent messages that a flow can process at any given time, whether the components are internal or external, flows or sources, and so on.

Although Mule applies back-pressure on its own, the `maxConcurrency` parameter helps to control the flow performance, especially when a backend server may affect when having high concurrency. See how to set the parameter in the following example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="perf-test-flow" maxConcurrency="${flow.max.concurrency}">
----

Similarly, you can limit the number of records that can be processed in a batch job by setting the `maxConcurrency` parameter as in the following example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<batch:job jobName="test-batch" maxConcurrency="${batch.max.concurrency}">
----

By default, the Flow and Async scopes do not set a `maxConcurrency` limit, but the Batch Job component limits concurrency to twice the number of available cores. The capacity of your system also limits concurrency.

== Components with Max Concurrency Settings

The following xref:about-components.adoc[components] provide a max concurrency setting: 

* Flow scope
* Scatter-Gather router
* Async scope
* Batch Job scope
* Parallel For Each scope

== Recommendation

Unless a lower concurrency is required to artificially trigger a back-pressure event, use the default settings, and do not change the max concurrency value.
