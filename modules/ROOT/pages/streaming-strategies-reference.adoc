|Parameter Name | Is required? | Expressions | Default Value | Description
| initialBufferSize
| NO
| NO
| 256
| This is the amount of memory that will be allocated in order to consume the stream and provide random
access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then it will be expanded
by according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize.
Default value is 256 KB.

| bufferSizeIncrement
| NO
| NO
| 256
| This is by how much will be buffer size by expanded if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or
lower will mean that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised
when the buffer gets full. Default value is 256 KB.

| maxInMemorySize
| NO
| NO
| 1024
| This is the maximum amount of memory that will be used. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error will be raised.
A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. Defaults to 1024

| bufferUnit
| NO
| NO
| KB
| The unit in which all these attributes are expressed. Possible values: BYTE, KB, MB, GB.
