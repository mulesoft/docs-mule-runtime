The Choice router dynamically routes messages through a flow according to a set of DataWeave expressions that evaluate message content. Each expression is associated with a different routing option. The effect is to add conditional processing to a flow, similar to an `if`/`then`/`else` code block in most programming languages.

Only one of the routes in the Choice router executes, meaning that the first expression that evaluates to `true` triggers that route's execution and the others are not checked. If none of the expressions are `true`, then the default route executes.

== Configuration

To configure the Choice router, specify one or more conditions to evaluate, and the message processors that execute when any condition evaluates to `true`. Additionally, configure a default route that executes when none of the defined conditions are `true`.

=== Anypoint Studio Configuration

To configure the Choice router in Studio, follow these steps:

image:mruntime-choice-configuration-studio.png[Choice configuration Studio]

. Drag the *Choice* component to any point of the flow.
. Click *When*, inside the Choice router, and configure the *Expression* value in the properties window to specify the condition to evaluate.
. Drag message processors inside *When* to specify the processors to execute when the condition is met.
. Drag message processors inside *Default* to specify the processors to execute when none of the defined conditions are met.

=== XML Configuration

Following is the basic XML structure for a Choice router:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<choice doc:name="Choice">
  <when expression=${expressionToEvaluate}> <1>
  	<!-- Message processors --> <2>
  </when>
  <otherwise>
    <!-- Message processors--> <3>
  </otherwise>
</choice>
----

<1> The `expression` attribute has the condition to evaluate.
<2> Add any number of message processors to execute if `expression` evaluates to `true`.
<3> Add any number of message processors to execute if none of the conditions evaluates to `true`.

== Adding Routes to the Choice Router

By default, the Choice router has one route option that executes when the configured DataWeave expression evaluates to `true`, and a default route that executes when none of the expressions in the existing routes are `true`. Add more routes when you need to evaluate more than one condition and then execute different operations depending on which condition is met.

=== Add Routes by Dragging Components in Studio

From *Mule Palette* in Anypoint Studio, click any component and drag it into the Choice router, where you see a vertical black line:

=== Add Routes by Editing the XML

You can also add additional route options to a Choice router by modifying the XML configuration file:

. In Studio, right-click the Choice router and select *Go to XML...*.
. Inside the `<choice>` element, add a `<when>` element:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<!--Content based routing example flow -->
<flow name="content-based-routingFlow">
  <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" path="/" doc:name="Listener"/>
  <set-variable variableName="language" value="#[attributes.queryParams.language]" doc:name="Set Variable" />
  <!-- Choice router block-->
  <choice doc:name="Choice" >
    <when expression="#[vars.language == 'Spanish']" >
      <set-payload value="Hola!" doc:name="Reply in Spanish" />
    </when>
    <when expression="#[vars.language == 'French']" >
      <set-payload value="Bonjour!" doc:name="Reply in French" />
    </when>
    <!-- This is the new route option added in this step -->
    <when>
    </when>
    <otherwise>
      <flow-ref name="reply-in-default-languageSub_Flow" doc:name="reply-in-default-languageSub_Flow" />
    </otherwise>
  </choice>
  <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Log the reply" message='#["The reply $(payload) means hello in $(vars.language)" ]'/>
</flow>
----

After adding a new `<when>` element, the new route option shows in the Message Flow view:

== Example Project

You can use Anypoint Studio to download the example project _Content-Based Routing_ from Anypoint Exchange. This project presents a working example of a flow that uses the Choice router.

.Flow with a Choice router with three options, one being the default option
image::mruntime-choice-example.png[choice-router-example]

To download and open this example project:

. Click the Exchange icon (image:mruntime-exchange-icon.png["", 5%, 5%]) in Anypoint Studio.
. In the left panel, click *All assets*.
. In the window that opens, log in to Anypoint Exchange and search for the example project Content-Based Routing.
. Click the Open icon (image:mruntime-open-exchange-icon.png["", 5%, 5%]).

=== Behavior of the Example Project

When you run the project as a Mule application, the application performs the following actions:

. Listens for messages.
. Passes messages to a Set Variable component that sets the variable `language` to the language that is passed in the message by the parameter `language`.
. Uses a  Choice router to find out whether each message contains a `language` attribute. The presence and value of this attribute determine how the Choice router routes the message:

  - If the value is `French`, the router routes the message to a Set Payload component that is named _Reply in French_. This latter component returns the message `Bonjour!` to the requester.
  - If the value is `Spanish`, the router routes the message to a Set Payload component that is named _Reply in Spanish_. This latter component returns the message `Hola!` to the requester.
  - If the message contains no `language` attribute, the router routes the message to the default path, which is a subflow that:

. Logs the message "No language specified. Using English as a default." to the console
. Sets the value of `language` to `English`.
. Returns the message `Hello!`.

The example project demonstrates that, when you are planning to route messages in a flow by using a Choice router, there are four aspects to planning that you need to consider:

* The content that the Choice router evaluates to determine how it routes messages
* The number of routes
* The default routing option
* The processing that the flow performs for each routing option

== Choice Router XML Reference

A Choice flow control component contains these elements:

* A single root element `<choice>`
* A `<when>` child element for each routing option, each with an expression to match
* Optionally, an `<otherwise>` child element of Choice that handles all cases where none of the expressions on the `<when>` elements evaluate to `true`
* Components that are conditionally executed under each of the choices are defined as child elements of the `when` and `otherwise` elements
