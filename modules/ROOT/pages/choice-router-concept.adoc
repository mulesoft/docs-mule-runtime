The Choice router dynamically routes messages through a flow according to a set of DataWeave expressions that evaluate message content. Each expression is associated with a different routing option. The effect is to add conditional processing to a flow, similar to an `if`/`then`/`else` code block in most programming languages.

== Example

You can use Anypoint Studio to download the example project _Content-Based Routing_ from Anypoint Exchange. This project presents a working example of a flow that uses the Choice router.

When you run the project as a Mule application, the application performs the following actions:

. Listens for messages.
. Passes messages to a Set Variable component that sets the variable `language` to the language that is passed in the message by the parameter `language`.
. Uses a  Choice router to find out whether each message contains a `language` attribute. The presence and value of this attribute determine how the Choice router routes the message:

  - If the value is `French`, the router routes the message to a Set Payload component that is named _Reply in French_. This latter component returns the message `Bonjour!` to the requester.
  - If the value is `Spanish`, the router routes the message to a Set Payload component that is named _Reply in Spanish_. This latter component returns the message `Hola!` to the requester.
  - If the message contains no `language` attribute, the router routes the message to the default path, which is a subflow that:

. Logs the message "No language specified. Using English as a default." to the console
. Sets the value of `language` to `English`.
. Returns the message `Hello!`.

The example project demonstrates that, when you are planning to route messages in a flow by using a Choice router, there are four aspects to planning that you need to consider:

* The content that the Choice router evaluates to determine how it routes messages
* The number of routes
* The default routing option
* The processing that the flow performs for each routing option

To download and open this example project while you are in Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the upper-left corner. Then, in the window that opens, log into Anypoint Exchange and search on the name of the project.
