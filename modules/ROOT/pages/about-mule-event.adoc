A Mule event contains the core information processed by the runtime. It travels through components inside your Mule app following the configured application logic.

Note that the Mule event is immutable, so every change to an instance of a Mule event results in the creation of a new instance.

A Mule Event is composed of these objects:

* A Mule Message contains a message payload and its associated attributes.
* Variables are Mule event metadata that you use in your flow.

A Mule event is generated when a trigger (such as an HTTP request or a change to a database or file) reaches the Event source of a flow. This trigger could be an external event triggered by a resource that might be external to the Mule app.

. A trigger reaches the event source.
. The event source produces a Mule event.
. The Mule event travels sequentially through the components of a flow.
. Each component interacts in a pre-defined manner with the Mule event.
// REVIEW: Would it make sense to show Event Context (ExecutionContext) ?
// === Event Context
//The ExecutionContext that does not change within the scope of a single request and has the orginalPayload, MEP, credentials as well as reference to txContext and muleContext.

Note for developers and advanced users:

The Mule message and event are immutable objects, which means that they are not modifiable after they are constructed. Immutable objects have ‘thread-safe’ and ‘share-freely’ attributes, which both prevent potential concurrency issues and avoid the need for Mule to defensively copy the Message to avoid modifications to the original object.

Though immutability does not impact app design, it is important because branched execution is typical of most integrations, and the Mule runtime itself is multi-threaded. It also explains why you cannot mutate the message payload, attributes, or any variables through DataWeave expressions.

http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=15:
If the mutable object field's state should be changed only by the native class, then a defensive copy of the mutable object must be made any time it's passed into (constructors and set methods) or out of (get methods) the class. If this is not done, then it's simple for the caller to break encapsulation, by changing the state of an object which is simultaneously visible to both the class and its caller.
