MuleSoft makes available a trial version of the Enterprise Edition of Mule runtime engine (Mule) for the purpose of evaluation. Though perfect for exploring Mule and Anypoint Studio, the trial license for Enterprise limits usage of Mule and is not appropriate for production uses.

Complete the following steps to acquire and install a non-trial *Enterprise license* before you use Mule runtime in a production environment.

. Contact your MuleSoft account representative or http://www.mulesoft.com/contact[the MuleSoft sales team] to acquire an *Enterprise license* in the form of a `license.lic` file.
. Before installing, it's recommended to remove the previous License from your `$MULE_HOME` directory. To do so, navigate to `$MULE_HOME/conf/` and delete the existing `muleLicenseKey.lic` file.
. If you are installing your license on multiple platforms, back up your new `license.lic` file in another location before proceeding.
. Make sure that the Mule Server is *stopped (not running)* and then open the terminal or command line on your system.
. On *Mac/Unix/Linux*, from the `$MULE_HOME/bin` directory, run the following command:
+
`mule -installLicense ~/license.lic` +
 +
On *Windows*, first copy the `license.lic` file into the \bin folder, then execute the following in the command line: +
 +
`mule -installLicense license.lic `
. In the `$MULE_HOME/conf` directory, Mule saves a new file called `muleLicenseKey.lic`. This shows that the license has been installed.
. *Start* your Mule Server again, by the usual means.
+

== Verify or Remove Enterprise Edition License

Make sure that the Mule Server is *stopped* and then open the terminal or command line on your system.

To verify that Mule successfully installed your Enterprise license, run the following command:

`mule -verifyLicense`

To uninstall a previously installed license, run the following command:

`mule -unInstallLicense`

Sometimes the license installation fails and it might be necessary to manually delete `$MULE_HOME/conf/muleLicenseKey.lic`
