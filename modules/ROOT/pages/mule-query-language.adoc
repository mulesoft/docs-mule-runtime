= Mule Query Language

MQL is a LINQ inspired query language for Java and Mule. With it you can *filter, join and transform data from Mule messages, cloud connectors, and Spring beans* in very concise code. And with the `<mql:query-service>` support inside Mule, you can instantly turn that query into a REST service. MQL is currently in beta.

Here are some quick samples:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Description |Query
|Filter Data a|

[source,text,linenums]
----
from userManager.users   where division = ‘Sales’ and     (email like ‘mulesoft.com’ or email like ‘mulesource.com’)
----

Queries userManager.getUsers() and returns all users which are in Sales and have an email which contains "mulesoft.com" or "mulesource.com"

|Transform data into a Map/POJO a|

[source,text,linenums]
----
from userManager.users as u select new {  href = 'http://localhost/users/' + u.id,  name = u.firstName + ' ' + u.lastName,  division = u.division}
----

Queries userManager.getUsers() and creates new objects which have the href, name and division properties. This object will be a `Map` by default, but can also be a POJO by using syntax like `new(com.foo.UserSummary)` in the select statement.

|Join data from Salesforce a|

[source,text,linenums]
----
from userManager.users as user  join salesforce.query('SELECT Company, MobilePhone                          FROM Lead                          WHERE Email = \'' + user.email + '\'', 1)    as sfuser  select new {    name = user.name,    email = user.email,    company = sfuser[0].?Company,    mobilePhone = sfuser[0].?MobilePhone  }
----

Queries userManager.getUsers() and for each user calls the SalesForce cloud connector to retrieve user information based on the users's email address. In the select statement, we're creating a new object based on both the local data (name and email) and the SalesForce data (company and mobile phone).

|Instant REST service a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mql:query-service name="UsersService"   address="http://localhost:9002/mulesoft-users"  query="from userManager.users as u where email like 'mulesoft.com'"/>
----

Creates a REST services on the specified address which executes the specified query. Data is returned in JSON format.

|Transform Mule messages a|

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mql:transform query="select new { name = u.name, email = u.email}"/>
----

Takes a Mule message payload (POJO or JSON data) and transforms it into a new object (POJO or JSON). If the payload is a Collection, it will transform each individual object. If the payload is a single object, it will return a single transformed object.
