The *Mule Digital Signature Processor* adds a digital signature to a message payload, or part of the payload, to prove the identity of the message’s sender. Mule can also verify a signature on a message it receives to confirm the authenticity of the message’s sender. To sign or verify the signature of a message, Mule uses one of the following two Digital Signature Strategies:

. JCE Signer
. XML Signer

As the sender of a message, use a digital signature when you want to advise the message’s receiver that you are a legitimate sender and that you vouch for all, or part, of its contents.

Use the table below to determine which type of digital signature strategy best suits your security needs.

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Digital Signature Strategy |Characteristics
|JCE Signer |• sign a message payload, or part of a payload, using a key and algorithm
|XML Signer |• sign a message payload, or part of a payload, using a keystore +
• apply attributes to specify the type of algorithm, and type of signature
|===

As the receiver of a message, use the digital signature feature when you need to verify the identity and confirm the legitimacy of its sender.

== Adding a Digital JCE Signature to a Message

As Mule’s default signature strategy, the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html[Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)] signer, part of the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA), enriches a message payload with a digital signature.

[NOTE]
This topic introduces the idea of Global Elements; if you are unfamiliar with this functionality, access xref:global-elements.adoc[Global Elements] to learn more before proceeding.

At minimum, you must explicitly define the following:

* a *Global Signature* element
* a *Signature* message processor in your Mule flow

[NOTE]
====
*Global vs. Local*

To apply a digital signature to a message in Mule, you must use two elements, as described above: a *Signature message processor* in a Mule flow, and a *Global Signature* element to which the Signature message processor refers for configuration information.

The example below uses a *Global Signature* element to apply most of the attribute configurations of the digital signature, the three minimum configurations Mule needs to apply a digital signature: default signer, algorithm, and key. The example then uses a local *Signature* message processor within a Mule flow to reference the Global Signature element.

However, you can reverse the configuration so that the local *Signature* message processor contains most of the configuration information – including the minimum configurations – and the *Global Signature* element contains only the Default Signer type: JCE_SIGNER.

Either configuration is fine, though you may wish to use the former if you intend to apply the same type of signature to messages in several flows in your Mule application. In such a case, a global element saves you from coding the same configurations multiple times in one application.

Note that any configuration entered in the local message processor will further specify or override any configuration in the global element and will cause the application to refer only to the configurations in the global element which do not conflict with local configurations. For example, you could first configure a global element properties for *Algorithm*, *Keystore Path*, and *Keystore Password* and apply this global element multiple times within one application. Then, within each message processor that references this global element, you can configure the local attributes for *Key* and *Key Password* to specify which key within the keystore should be referenced for each specific message processor. You can also select a different *Algorithm* than the one you configured in the global element – this locally configured algorithm will override the algorithm specified in the global element for this message processor only.
====

You can define the required configurations in either the Global Signature element or the local Signature message processor. Note, however, that you can only instruct Mule to use a key in a keystore via the configurations in the Global Signature element.

The following procedure describes how to apply JCE digital signatures to messages processed in a Mule flow.


=== Adding a Digital JCE Signature to a Message (Studio Visual Editor)

. Add a global *Signature* message processor to your application, applying a unique *Name* for the element and keeping the default value, `JCE_SIGNER`, in the *Default Signer* field (see image below, left).
. Click the *JceSigner* tab (see image below, right), then configure the message processor's attributes according to the table below. Note that while none of the attributes on the Jce Signer tab are required, this global element is the only place you can define a *Keystore Path* and *Keystore Password* for your Signature element.

|Field |Req'd |Value
|*Reference or expression* |  |If selected, in the *Jce Signer Reference*, use an expression to reference attributes you have defined elsewhere in the XML configuration of your applications, or to reference the configurations defined in a bean.
|*Define attributes* |  |If selected, enter values in the following five fields.
|*Algorithm* |  |Algorithm to encrypt the key, not required if using a keystore. Refer to Appendix for list of available algorithms.
|*Key* |  |Unique key that encrypts and decrypts message; or, if using keystore, the name of the specific key within the keystore.

|*Key Password* |  |Password to read the key within the keystore; required only if the specific keys within the keystore have their own passwords.
|===
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using a *Keystore*, you must also define a *Key* to specify which key within the keystore the application should invoke. The key can be configured either on the Global Element Properties window or in the Pattern Properties window.
+
* If configured in the Global Element Properties window, that key will be invoked for all message processors which refer to that global element — unless there is a different key specified in the local Pattern Properties window for that processor, because local configuration overrides global configurations.
* If configured in the local Pattern Properties window, that key will be invoked only for that message processor, so any other message processors in the same flow that also refer to that global element would need a key configured in their Pattern Properties windows.

== Adding a PGP Signature to a Message

The PGP Signer enriches a message payload with a digital signature.

At minimum, you must explicitly define the following:

* a *Global Signature* element
* a *Signature* message processor in your Mule flow

You can define the required configurations in either the Global Signature element or the local Signature message processor. Refer to the Global vs. Local tip above for more information on how to apply configurations. Note, however, that you can only instruct Mule to use a key in a keystore via the configurations in the Global Signature element.

The following procedure describes how to apply XML digital signatures to messages processed in a Mule flow.

=== Adding a PGP Signature to a Message (Studio Visual Editor)

. Add a global *Signature* message processor to your application, applying a unique *Name* for the element and change the default value, `JCE_SIGNER`, in the *Default Signer* field  to PGP_SIGNER.
. Click the **PGP_SIGNER** tab, then configure the message processor's attributes according to the table below.

== Signing Part of a Message Payload

By default, Mule signs the entire message payload when you apply a signature. However, you can use a Mule Expression to sign a specific part of a message payload rather than the whole payload. Enter a Mule expression in the *Input Reference* field of a JCE or XML Signature message processor to define the specific part(s) of the payload you wish to sign.

== Applying a Signature Using MEL

As described above, to apply a digital signature to a message in Mule, you normally need two ingredients:

* a *Global Signature* element which defines all, or some, of the signature attributes
* a *Signature* message processor in a Mule flow which defines all, or some, of the signature attributes

However, you can also add a signature to a message without adding a Signature message processor to a Mule flow. To do so, you need:

* a *Global Signature* element which defines all of the signature attributes
* a *Mule expression* appended to a message processor as *message attribute*, which references the Global Signature element to apply a signature to the message

To reference a Global Signature element via Mule expression in another element, you must first set the Global Signature element's *Enable Language* attribute to true (below, left), then apply all the Global Signature attributes (below, right).

Then, add a *message attribute* to an element in your flow, a Logger, for example, to apply a digital signature according to the configurations in the Global Signature element.

== Verifying a Digital Signature

In addition to signing a message, Mule also uses a Signature message processor to verify the identity of a message’s sender as legitimate. Where Mule discovers an invalid signature, it discards the message, processing it no further.

Mule verifies the signature on the message payload according to the configurations of any of the optional attributes if explicitly defined (see lists above for JCE- and XML-specific attributes).

[NOTE]
This topic introduces the idea of Global Elements; if you are unfamiliar with this functionality, access xref:global-elements.adoc[Global Elements] to learn more before proceeding.

To verify JCE or XML signatures on messages in a Mule flow, you must, at minimum, create:

* a *Global Signature* element
* a *Signature* message processor in your Mule flow

The following procedure describes how to verify digital signatures on messages a Mule flow receives.

. In your Mule flow, add a *Signature* message processor early in your flow in Studio to verify signatures on messages that arrive to be processed.
. In the *Operations field*, select `Verify Signature`. Alternatively, add a Signature element to your flow, configured to verify signatures (see code, below).
+
[source,xml,linenums]

<signature:verify-signature config-ref="" doc:name="Signature"/>
----

[start=3]
. Use the *Using* field (or `using` attribute in XML) to indicate the type of signature:` JCE_SIGNER` or `XML_SIGNER`.
. Optionally, enter a Mule expression in the *Input Reference* field to indicate the part of the message payload to which the signature applies. In other words, a signature may apply to only part of the message payload.
. In the *Expected Signature* field, enter a Mule expression that Mule can use to compare and verify that the signature on a received message is authentic. +
. Optionally, select the *Fail On Verification* option to have an exception thrown when the signature on the message does not match the expected signature. Defaults to false.

The following image shows the *Verify User Signature* fields:

In the XML editor, the *Verify User Signature* section looks like this:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<signature:verify-signature config-ref="" doc:name="Signature" failOnVerification="true"/>
----

[start=7]
. Configure any other attributes of the local Signature message processor. Refer to the JCE Signer and XML Signer sections above for attribute configuration details. Also, refer to the Global vs. Local tip to decide which attributes to configure locally, on the Signature message processor, and which attributes to configure in the Global Signature element.
. Configure any other attributes of a Global Signature element. Again, refer to the JCE Signer and XML Signer sections above for attribute configuration details.
. Configure the Signature message processor to reference the Global Signature element.
