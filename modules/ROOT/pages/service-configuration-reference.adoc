This page provides details on the elements you configure for services. This information is pulled directly from `mule.xsd` and is cached. If the information appears to be out of date, refresh the page. For more information on services, see xref:configuring-the-service.adoc[Configuring the Service].

== Service

Describes how to receive messages, deliver them to a component, and handle the results (if any).

=== Attributes of <service...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name |yes |  |The name used to identify this service.
|initialState |enumeration |no |started |The initial state of the service. Usually a service is started automatically ("started"), but this attribute can be used to disable initial startup ("stopped") or start the service in a paused state ("paused").
|queueTimeout |integer |no |  |The timeout used when taking messages from the service queue.
|===

=== Child Elements of <service...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|description |0..1 |This can hold any kind of documentation related to the service. It is intended to be "human readable" only and is not used by the system.
|inbound |0..1 |The elements within 'inbound' describe how a service receives messages.
|abstract-component |0..1 |The service component that is invoked when incoming messages are received. If this element is not present, the service simply bridges the inbound and outbound using a pass-through component. A placeholder for a component element. A component is invoked when inbound messages are received by the service.
|outbound |0..1 |The elements within 'outbound' describe how a service sends or dispatches messages.
|async-reply |0..1 |The elements within 'async-reply' describe how asynchronous replies are handled.
|abstract-exception-strategy |0..1 |A placeholder for an exception strategy element. Exception strategies define how Mule should react to errors.
|abstract-message-info-mapping |0..1 |The message info mapper used to extract key bits of the message information, such as Message ID or Correlation ID. these properties are used by some routers and this mapping information tells Mule where to get the information from in the current message. Maps the attributes of the current message to known message elements in Mule, namely Message ID and CorrrelationID.
|abstract-service-threading-profile |0..1 |A placeholder for the service threading profile element. Threading profiles define how thread pools are used by a service.
|abstract-queue-profile |0..1 |A placeholder for a queue profile, which controls how messages are queued.
|===

== Custom service

A user-implemented service (typically used only in testing).

=== Attributes of <custom-service...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name |yes |  |The name used to identify this service.
|initialState |enumeration |no |started |The initial state of the service. Usually a service is started automatically ("started"), but this attribute can be used to disable initial startup ("stopped") or start the service in a paused state ("paused").
|class |class name |yes |  |The class to use for the service.
|===

=== Child Elements of <custom-service...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|description |0..1 |This can hold any kind of documentation related to the service. It is intended to be "human readable" only and is not used by the system.
|inbound |0..1 |The elements within 'inbound' describe how a service receives messages.
|abstract-component |0..1 |The service component that is invoked when incoming messages are received. If this element is not present, the service simply bridges the inbound and outbound using a pass-through component. A placeholder for a component element. A component is invoked when inbound messages are received by the service.
|outbound |0..1 |The elements within 'outbound' describe how a service sends or dispatches messages.
|async-reply |0..1 |The elements within 'async-reply' describe how asynchronous replies are handled.
|abstract-exception-strategy |0..1 |A placeholder for an exception strategy element. Exception strategies define how Mule should react to errors.
|abstract-message-info-mapping |0..1 |The message info mapper used to extract key bits of the message information, such as Message ID or Correlation ID. these properties are used by some routers and this mapping information tells Mule where to get the information from in the current message. Maps the attributes of the current message to known message elements in Mule, namely Message ID and CorrrelationID.
|spring:property |0..* |Spring-style property element for custom configuration.
|===

== Inbound

The elements within 'inbound' describe how a service receives messages.

=== Attributes of <inbound...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|===

=== Child Elements of <inbound...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|abstract-inbound-endpoint |0..* |A placeholder for inbound endpoint elements. Inbound endpoints receive messages from the underlying transport. The message payload is then delivered to the component for processing.
|abstract-catch-all-strategy |0..1 |A placeholder for catch-all strategy elements.
|abstract-inbound-router |0..1 |A placeholder for inbound router elements, which control how incoming messages are handled.
|abstract-transformer |0..1 |A placeholder for transformer elements. Transformers convert message payloads.
|splitter |0..1 |The simple splitter splits incoming message into parts using the configured expression passing on each part in turn to the next message processor
|collection-splitter |0..1 |The collection splitter accepts a collection of objects and splits the collection invoking the next message processor with each item in the collection in sequence.
|processor |0..1 |A reference to a message processor defined elsewhere.
|custom-processor |0..1 |
|===

== Outbound

The elements within 'outbound' describe how a service sends or dispatches messages.

=== Attributes of <outbound...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|matchAll |boolean |no |false |If true, the output message will be sent to all routers. Otherwise, only the first matching router is used.
|===

=== Child Elements of <outbound...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|abstract-outbound-router |0..* |A placeholder for outbound router elements, which control how outgoing messages are delivered to the outbound endpoints.
|abstract-catch-all-strategy |0..1 |A placeholder for catch-all strategy elements.
|===

== Async reply

The elements within 'async-reply' describe how asynchronous replies are handled.

=== Attributes of <async-reply...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|timeout |integer |no |  |The timeout (ms) to wait for a reply.
|failOnTimeout |boolean |no |  |If the router times out before all expected events have been received, specifies whether an exception should be thrown (true) or the current events should be returned for processing (false). The default is true.
|===

=== Child Elements of <async-reply...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|abstract-inbound-endpoint |1..* |A placeholder for inbound endpoint elements. Inbound endpoints receive messages from the underlying transport. The message payload is then delivered to the component for processing.
|abstract-async-reply-router |0..1 |A placeholder for an async reply router element. Asynchronous replies are handled via this router.
|abstract-inbound-router |0..1 |A placeholder for inbound router elements, which control how incoming messages are handled.
|processor |0..1 |A reference to a message processor defined elsewhere.
|custom-processor |0..1 |
|===

== Queue profile

Specifies the properties of an internal Mule queue. Internal queues are used to queue messages for each component managed by Mule.
