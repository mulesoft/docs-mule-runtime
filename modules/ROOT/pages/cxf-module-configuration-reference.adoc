This page provides reference information about the elements and attributes you can configure for the xref:cxf-module-reference.adoc[CXF Module Reference].

== Configuration

.Attributes of <configuration...>
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|configurationLocation |string |no | |The location of a CXF configuration file, if any needs to be supplied.
|enableMuleSoapHeaders |boolean |no |true |Whether or not CXF should write Mule SOAP headers which pass along the correlation and ReplyTo information. This is true by default, but the Mule SOAP headers are only triggered in situations where there is an existing correlation ID and the ReplyTo header is set (As of 2.2.1)
|initializeStaticBusInstance |boolean |no |true |Initialize the static CXF Bus with a Bus configured to use Mule for all transports. This will affect any CXF generated clients that you run standalone. Defaults to true.
|name |string |no |_cxfConfiguration |
|===

== Jaxws service

.Attributes of <jaxws-service...>
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|bindingId |string |no | |The binding that should be used for this endpoint. It defaults to the SOAP binding by default.
|port |string |no | |The WSDL port name of your service.
|namespace |string |no | |The service namespace (As of 2.2.1)
|serviceClass |string |no | |The class CXF should use to construct its service model. This is optional, and by default it will use the implementation class of your component, on inbound cxf endpoint. But it is mandatory for outbound endpoint when using "aegis" frontend.
|validationEnabled |boolean |no | |Whether or not validation should be enabled on this service. Validation only occurs on inbound server messages.
|soapVersion |enumeration |no | |The soapVersion that is going to be used for this endpoint. The specified version is translated into the corresponding bindingId value. This attribute is useful when there's need to avoid the creation of the endpoint with the default binding. In case the bindingId attribute is set this attribute will override it. If not set and not specified otherwise CXF default to SOAP 1.1 binding.
|mtomEnabled |boolean |no | |Whether or not MTOM (attachment support) is enabled for this endpoint.
|wsdlLocation |string |no | |The location of the WSDL for your service. If this is a server side endpoint it will served to your users.
|enableMuleSoapHeaders |boolean |no |true |Whether or not this endpoint should write Mule SOAP headers which pass along the correlation and ReplyTo information. This is true by default, but the Mule SOAP headers are only triggered in situations where there is an existing correlation ID and the ReplyTo header is set. (As 2.2.1)
|configuration-ref |string |no | |The CXF configuration that should be used.
|===

.Child Elements of <jaxws-service...>
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|schemaLocations |0..1 |
|ws-security |0..1 |Configuration to enable WS-Security
|properties |0..1 |Additional properties for this service.
|abstract-databinding |0..1 |The databinding implementation that should be used. By default, this JAXB for the JAX-WS frontend and Aegis for the simple frontend. A placeholder for arbitrary extensions as children of the 'mule' element. Other transports and modules can extend this if they need to add global elements to the configuration (but consider the more specific elements like abstract-connector first).
|features |0..1 |Any CXF features you want to apply to the client/server. See the CXF documentation for more information on features.
|inInterceptors |0..1 |Additional incoming interceptors for this service.
|inFaultInterceptors |0..1 |Additional incoming fault interceptors.
|outInterceptors |0..1 |Additional outgoing interceptors.
|outFaultInterceptors |0..1 |Additional outgoing fault interceptors.
|===

== Jaxws client

.Attributes of <jaxws-client...>
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|soapVersion |enumeration |no | |The soapVersion that is going to be used for this endpoint. The specified version is translated into the corresponding bindingId value. This attribute is useful when there's need to avoid the creation of the endpoint with the default binding. In case the bindingId attribute is set this attribute will override it. If not set and not specified otherwise CXF defaults to SOAP 1.1 binding.
|mtomEnabled |boolean |no |true |Whether or not this endpoint should write Mule SOAP headers which pass along the correlation and ReplyTo information. This is true by default, but the Mule SOAP headers are only triggered in situations where there is an existing correlation ID and the ReplyTo header is set (As of 2.2.1)
|configuration-ref |string |no | |The CXF configuration that should be used.
|serviceClass |string |no | |The class CXF should use to construct its service model for the client.
|decoupledEndpoint |string |no | |The reply to endpoint for clients which have WS-Addressing enabled.
|operation |string |no | |The reply to endpoint for clients which have WS-Addressing enabled.
|clientClass |string |no | |The name of the client class that CXF generated using CXF's wsdl2java tool. You must use wsdl2java if you do not have both client and the server in the same JVM. Otherwise, this can be optional if the endpoint address is the same in both cases.
|port |string |no | |The WSDL port you want to use to communicate with the service.

== Common CXF Element

Following are the sub-elements you can set on the CXF service and client. For further information on CXF interceptors, see the http://cxf.apache.org/docs/interceptors.html[CXF documentation].
