[[decodeuri1]]
== decodeURI(String): String

Decodes the escape sequences (such as `%20`) in a URI.


The function replaces each escape sequence in the encoded URI with the
character that it represents, but does not decode escape sequences that
could not have been introduced by `encodeURI`. The character `#` is not
decoded from escape sequences.

=== Parameters

which is used for spaces.
