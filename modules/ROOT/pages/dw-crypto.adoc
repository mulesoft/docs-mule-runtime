= Crypto (dw::Crypto)

This module provide functions that perform encryptions through common
algorithms, such as MD5, SHA1, and so on.


To use this module, you must import it to your DataWeave code, for example,
by adding the line `import * from dw::Crypto` to the header of your
DataWeave script.

| Name  | Description
| xref:dw-crypto-functions-hmacbinary.adoc[HMACBinary] | Computes an HMAC hash (with a secret cryptographic key) on input content.
| xref:dw-crypto-functions-hmacwith.adoc[HMACWith] | Computes an HMAC hash (with a secret cryptographic key) on input content,
then transforms the result into a lowercase, hexadecimal string.
| xref:dw-crypto-functions-md5.adoc[MD5] | Computes the MD5 hash and transforms the binary result into a
hexadecimal lower case string.
| xref:dw-crypto-functions-sha1.adoc[SHA1] | Computes the SHA1 hash and transforms the result into a hexadecimal,
lowercase string.
| xref:dw-crypto-functions-hashwith.adoc[hashWith] | Computes the hash of binary content with a specified algorithm.
