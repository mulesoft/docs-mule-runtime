NOTE: This connector does not support the use of a security token.

== Authentication

The Microsoft SharePoint connector supports different authentication schemes based on which
Microsoft SharePoint that you access:

Supported Microsoft SharePoint authentication on-premise:

* NTLM
* Claims-based authentication against Microsoft ADFS
// * Security token obtained from Microsoft ADFS
* Unsupported authentication: Kerberos

Supported Microsoft SharePoint Online authentication:

* Microsoft Online (Office 365) managed users
* Microsoft Online (Office 365) federated users against Microsoft ADFS
// * Security token obtained from Microsoft Online
* Standard SharePoint Online user credentials

=== Claims-Based Authentication

NOTE: This connector version does not support the use of a security token.

Configuring the connector to use claims-based authentication requires the following information from the Security Token Service (STS) that to use for authenticating:

* *Sts Url*: The STS endpoint that accepts username and password for authenticating users and understands the WS-Trust 1.3 protocol. When the STS is Microsoft’s ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services), this URL usually is `https://youradfs.com/adfs/services/trust/13/usernamemixed`.
* *Sts App Identifier*: A string that identifies the Sharepoint site in the STS. It is also known as Relying Party Identifier, Client Identifier, Scope, or Realm. When the STS is Microsoft’s ADFS, this value can be discovered in the AD FS Management console under AD FS at *Trust Relationships* > *Relying Party Trusts* > _(Sharepoint Site’s relying part properties)_ > *Identifiers* tab.
+
You can obtain the STS App Identifier by logging into the Sharepoint Site that you want to be accessed by opening the Site URL in a web browser. If there is more than one authentication provider configured for a site, a drop-down menu lists the options. Select the desired STS to be redirected to the STS’s login page. At this point, the address bar of the web browser contains a URL that includes the following query parameters: +
+
`wa=wsignin1.0&wtrealm=uri%3amule%3asp80`
+
The parameter *_wa_* tells the STS that a signin is being initiated. The *_wtrealm_* contains the URI-encoded value for the Sts App Identifier. In the example, `uri%3amule%3asp80` is `uri:mule:sp80`. The unencoded value is the parameter for the connector’s configuration.

=== Security Token Authentication

NOTE: This connector version does not support the use of a security token.

In cases where it is not possible to configure a connection depending on username and password, or when you need to authenticate using a custom Security Token Service (STS) (different from the supported ones), the `Security Token Connection` settings allow you to provide the security token that you obtained from your custom STS. This configuration requires you that you set up the following information to use for authenticating:

* *Security Token*: (Optional) A string containing the security token (that is, a full XML document) obtained from your STS to authenticate the connection with your Sharepoint instance. If you don't configure the security token in this setting, you need to provide a `Security Token Provider` as defined in the advanced section's setting detailed below.
* *Instance Type*: Indicates if the connector should authenticate to an on-premises or an on-line instance as each one provides different endpoints and methods to attach the security token and authenticate the connection.

In addition to the basic configuration shown above, there is an advanced setting where you can provide a `Security Token Provider` instance of your own. This mechanism allows you to obtain the security token using a custom implementation and allows the connector refreshing the connection when the token has expired (which is not the case for when just providing the `Security Token` as XML document).

* *Security Token Provider*: (Optional) A string that references to a Spring bean which should be a class that implements the `org.mule.module.sharepoint.connection.providers.SecurityTokenProvider` interface. Within the implementation you are responsible of providing a security token each time the connector requests one. In order to provide a reference to your own implementation as a Spring bean, refer to the following xref:using-spring-beans-as-flow-components.adoc[documentation].

.. For authentication:
* If using a self-signed SSL certificate, and click the *Disable SSL certificate validation* checkbox.
* To connect with Claims Authentication, fill in STS URL (Security Token Service) and scope (Relying Party Identifier).  The STS URL has to point to the endpoint of the STS that accepts username and password as authentication credentials and understands WS-Trust 1.3 standard. In ADFS, the endpoint is usually `+https://myadfs.com/adfs/services/trust/13/usernamemixed+`. Also, the endpoint has to be enabled in ADFS (it is enabled by default).
* To connect with NTLM Authentication, fill in *Domain*.
* To connect to SharePoint Online, leave  NTLM and Claims inputs empty. Just specify a *Username*, *Password*, and *Site URL*.
+
.. Click *Test Connection* to ensure the connection works correctly:
+

----

== Operations: Lists and List Items API

Use the Lists and List Items API to create, retrieve, update, and delete SharePoint lists and list items.

=== Creating, Updating, and Deleting List Items

When creating or updating an item, specify the list ID. After you specify an ID, DataSense fetches the list's metadata and the object builder shows each field that can be completed:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:list-create 
    config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" 
    doc:name="Sharepoint 2013" 
    baseTemplate="GENERIC_LIST" 
    title="Title">
  <sharepoint-2013:list ref="#[payload]"/>
</sharepoint-2013:list-create>
----

Or define the attributes in the connector itself:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:list-create 
    config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" 
    doc:name="Sharepoint 2013" 
    baseTemplate="GENERIC_LIST" 
    title="Title">
  <sharepoint-2013:list 
    contentTypesEnabled="true" 
    description="Description"/>
</sharepoint-2013:list-create>
----

For retrieving and deleting lists, only the list ID is necessary:

[source,xml]
----
<sharepoint-2013:list-delete config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013" listId="8e306633-c600-40ab-80db-80f57968c0a1" />
----

=== Creating, Updating, and Deleting List Items

When creating or updating an item, specify a list ID. DataSense uses the list ID to fetch a list's metadata. The Object Builder provides the fields you need to complete.

image::msspobjectbuilder.png[MSSPObjectBuilder]

=== Querying List Items

Using the query builder:

On the left panel, every not hidden list appears. On the right panel, the fields of the selected list appear. If the field is a *Lookup Field*, the field type is either `SharepointListReference` or `SharepointListMultiValueReference`.

image::spquerybuilder.png[SPQueryBuilder]

If any of these fields are selected to be returned by the query, two types of return objects are available, depending on the value of the *Retrieve full objects for reference fields* checkbox:

* *not checked*: A summary object containing the reference object's ID and the reference object list's ID:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "Title": "A title",
    "LookupFieldId": {
        "id": "1",
        "lookupListId": "aaaa-1111-bbbb-2222"
    },
    "MultiValueLookupFieldId": {
        "ids": [
            1,
            2,
            3
        ],
        "lookupListId": "cccc-3333-dddd-4444"
    }
}
----
+
This object can later be used in another connector to retrieve the referenced object
together with a for-each component:
+
image::mssplistitemquery.png[MSSPListItemQuery]
+
* *checked*. Retrieves the full object graph. In case there is a cycle, the summary reference object displays:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
    "Title": "A title",
    "LookupFieldId": {
        "Title": "Another title",
        "Id": "1",
        "Property1": "A value"
    },
    "MultiValueLookupFieldId": [
        {
            "Title": "Another title",
            "Id": "1",
            "Property1": "A value"
        },
        {
            "Title": "Another title",
            "Id": "2",
            "Property1": "A value"
        }
    ]
}
----

Example *Query Text*:

image::spexampleqtext.png[SPExampleQText]

*Note:* Checking this option may cause large item lists with many reference fields to take a long time to retrieve.

Since version 2.1.10 of this connector you can use the _internal_ or _title_ field names in DSQL queries (as well as in other list's operations as detailed below).

For example for the previous query:

----
SELECT AuthorId, Created, List3MultiId FROM 8e306633-c600-40ab-80db-80f57968c0a1
----

If their _titles_ are the following _Author_, _Date created_ and _Details_ respectively, then you can write the query the using field names:

----
SELECT Author, 'Date created', Details FROM Inventory
----

As well as you can mix _internal_ and _title_ too:

----
SELECT AuthorId, 'Date created', List3MultiId FROM Inventory
----

Using _internal_ and/or _title_ field names is supported within the following list's operations ONLY:

- Adding a new item to the list
- Updating an existent item in the list
- Querying items in the list

*Note:* To filter by a datetime field type, write the value using ISO-8601 format when specified in a DSQL clause (for example, Created > 2000-01-01T00:00:00-03:00).

== Operations: File and Folder API

Using the File and Folder API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete files and folders, and also check in, check out, publish, approve, deny, copy, and recycle files from Documents Lists.

When using the folders operations, the server's relative URL refers to where the folder is or will be. The URL can be in the format _/site/docList/innerFolder_ or in _docList/innerFolder_  format. In the second case, the site specified in the connector's configuration site URL parameter is used.

When using the files operations, the file server relative URL refers to a folder server relative URL plus the filename: _/site/docList/innerFolder/filename_ or _docList/innerFolder/filename_.

=== Creating and Deleting a Folder

You can create or delete a folder by specifying the server relative URL where the folder is or where you plan to create the folder.

The resulting flow looks:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:folder-create config-ref="Sharepoint_2013"
url="/path/to/folder" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"/>

<sharepoint-2013:folder-delete config-ref="Sharepoint_2013"
url="/path/to/folder" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"/>
----

=== Adding a File

A file can be uploaded by selecting a physical file or passing an input stream to the connector, and it's uploaded to the specified server relative URL. For example, you can use this together with a File Connector to upload files to a list.

Using an input stream:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:file-add config-ref="Sharepoint_2013"
fileServerRelativeUrl="/path/to/folder/filename"
fileContentStream-ref="#[payload]" overwrite="true"
doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"/>
----

In order to upload large files you need to configure your Sharepoint and IIS servers:

- Set 'Maximum Upload Size' to 2047MB (max) at SP management console for site.
- Set connection timeout for IIS site to high value.
- Set the 'Maximum Allowed Content Length' to 2147483647 for IIS app (at request filtering).

NOTE: The Sharepoint REST API (which the connector uses) supports uploading files up to 2GB. When working with large files it's recommended to provide the system local path to the file (_localFilePath_ parameter's value) as it's the most efficient way to upload it through the connector.

=== Getting File Contents

The file content is returned as a byte array. For example, you can use this as an input of a File Connector to download files from a list:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:file-get-content config-ref="Sharepoint_2013"
doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"
fileServerRelativeUrl="/path/to/folder/filename"/>
----

=== Querying Files and Folders

This operation returns all the files and folders that match the specified criteria, starting from the specified folder.

Using the query builder:

* On the left panel, a document list from the SharePoint instance appears. The selected instance is used as part of the starting path to query the files and folders.
* On the right panel, for every document list, the same fields appear.
* Additionally, you can specify an inner folder or folders in the _Folder Path_ input, to use as the starting path.
* When selecting the recursive checkbox, files and folders are searched recursively in every folder of the starting path.

To set query builder options:

image::sharepointfolderpath.png[SharePointFolderPath]

Example:

[source,text,linenums]
----
sharepoint-2013:file-query config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" query="dsql:SELECT Author,ModifiedBy,Name,ServerRelativeUrl FROM #[header:inbound:documentListName]" recursive="true" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"/>

<sharepoint-2013:folder-query config-ref="Sharepoint_2013" recursive="true" query="dsql:SELECT ItemCount,Name,ServerRelativeUrl FROM #[header:inbound:documentListName] WHERE ItemCount &gt; 0" doc:name="Sharepoint 2013"/>
----

=== Other File Operations

Approve, Check In, Check Out, Deny, Publish, Undo Checkout, and Unpublish, are all very similar to use. Specify the file URL, and in some, pass an additional comment as a parameter.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sharepoint-2013:file-publish config-ref="Sharepoint_2013"
doc:name="Sharepoint 2013" fileServerRelativeUrl="" comment=""/>
----

=== Setting File Metadata

You can get and set metadata on files that are uploaded to Document Libraries by using the *Update List Item* operation.

To set the properties of the file in the list, you must know the *List Item Id*. This can be retrieved using the deferred *ListItemAllFields* property.

The following flow illustrates how a *File Add* may chain directly to an *Update List Item* operation to upload a file to a list and set the metadata immediately after:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="sharepoint_demo_fileAddWithMetadata"
   doc:name="sharepoint_demo_fileAddWithMetadata">
   <http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="request-response" host="localhost"
     port="8081" path="upload" doc:name="HTTP"/>
   <sharepoint:file-add config-ref="Sharepoint"
     fileServerRelativeUrl="/Shared Documents/myfile.txt"
     overwrite="true"
     doc:name="Add file"/>
   <sharepoint:resolve-object config-ref="Sharepoint"
     doc:name="Get ListItemId of File"
     url="#[payload.listItemAllFields.__deferred.uri]"/>
   <sharepoint:list-item-update config-ref="Sharepoint" itemId="#[payload.Id]"
     listId="ccbfaf65-b53e-48ac-be19-adf45192ecc3" doc:name="Set file properties">
       <sharepoint:updated-properties>
           <sharepoint:updated-property key="Title">Test title</sharepoint:updated-property>
       </sharepoint:updated-properties>
   </sharepoint:list-item-update>
   <set-payload value="OK" doc:name="Set Payload"/>
</flow>
----

== Resolving Deferred Properties

For performance reasons, many SharePoint operations return a basic set of data for an entity along with one or more deferred property references you can use to retrieve additional detail or related objects.

You can use the generic *Resolve object* or *Resolve collection* operations to resolve the deferred property set to a single `Map<string,object>` or a `List<Map<string,object>>` and access this information in the flow.

For example, this technique gets the full set of fields of a SharePoint File object:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sharepoint:resolve-object config-ref="SharePoint"
  url="#[payload.listItemAllFields.__deferred.url]"
  doc:name="Microsoft SharePoint" >
</sharepoint:resolve-object>
----

Using the Mule Debugger or Logger component to log the payload, you can identify properties with a `_deferred` URL property.

== Attaching a File to a List Item

To attach a file to a list item, use the ResolveObject operation as shown in this example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="sp-testFlow2">
    <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/at" doc:name="HTTP"/>
    <set-variable variableName="FileNameToAttach" value="CHANGELOG.md" doc:name="Set FileNameToAttach"/>
    <sharepoint:list-item-query config-ref="Microsoft_SharePoint__NTLM_Connection" query="dsql:SELECT ID,Title FROM 82b2a455-3faf-4162-8276-63a1093fcc7e WHERE Title = 'test-list-item-1'" doc:name="Read List Item"/>
    <set-variable variableName="ListItemUrl" value="#[payload.next() .__metadata.uri]" doc:name="SetListItemUri from list item query result"/>
    <set-payload value="#[groovy:new FileInputStream('C:\\temp\\' + flowVars.FileNameToAttach)]" doc:name="Set file to attach as inputstream in payload"/>
    <sharepoint:resolve-object config-ref="Microsoft_SharePoint__NTLM_Connection" url="#[flowVars.ListItemUrl]/AttachmentFiles/add(FileName='#[flowVars.FileNameToAttach]')" resolveRequestType="Create" doc:name="create attachment"/>
    <json:object-to-json-transformer doc:name="Object to JSON"/>
</flow>
----

The flow shows how to:

. Get the list item URI by reading it from SharePoint. If you already have the list item because it’s being created in the same flow, you can use that one.
. Read a file into an input stream. Here it's from c:\temp (find the path in the flow to replace it).
. Create the list item attachment with the file.

== Executing Direct Calls Against the REST API

SharePoint REST API allows a large number of commands that can be reached though *Resolve object* and *Resolve collection* actions. These operations provide an authenticated call to a specified URL, and resolves into a Map and a `List<Map>` respectively.

The *Resolve object* operation accepts all the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT/MERGE, DELETE) and allows sending a body in the request to the API. The body’s default value is the payload of the Mule message.

The body can be for API endpoints that accept a JSON:

* `Map<String, Object>` that is converted to a JSON string.
* `String` containing the JSON. This string is sent as-is.

For API endpoints that accept a file:

* `InputStream` with the file. The stream closes after using it.
* `byte[]` with the file. This byte arrays is sent as-is.

== Working with Choice Column Type with Multiple Values

You can configure a Choice column type to allow multiple values. The metadata in Studio for columns accepting multiple values appears as follows:

image::sharepointchoicemultiselect.png[SharePointChoiceMultiSelect]

Assuming that the target List in SharePoint has a Title property and a multi-select column called ChoiceMultiSelect that accepts values `"one"`, `"two"`, or `"three"`, the following Groovy script constructs a payload that sets the selection to `"one", "three"`:

----
[Title: "foo", ChoiceMultiSelect: [results: ["one", "three"]]]
----

Any language that can construct a `List<string>` for the multi-select column results property may be used to similar effect.

This block of pseudo code demonstrates how to set Choice #1 and Choice #2 as the values for the ChoiceMultiSelect column:

[source,text,linenums]
----
values = new List<String>
values.add("Choice #1")
values.add("Choice #2")
multiValuesMap = new Map<String, Object>
multiValuesMap["results"] = values
List-item["ChoiceMultiSelect"] = multiValuesMap
----

== Exception Handling

=== Exception When Connecting

If the connector fails to connect with the SharePoint instance for any reason, an exception of type ConnectionException is thrown.

The exception message helps debug the cause of the exception.

=== Exception in Operations

If when executing an operation, an error occurs, a SharepointException is thrown with a message about the error.
