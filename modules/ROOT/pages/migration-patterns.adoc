// Contacts/SMEs: Mariano Gonzales,

Migration patterns typically pertain to changes from Mule 3 to Mule 4 that affect more than one component, connector, or module.

* TODO (PLG): xref::migration-patterns-calling-java.adoc[Calling Java functions]
* TODO (sduke): <<target_vs_enricher>>: Short description here. Enrichment.

* TODO: Reconnection strategies? Standard, None, Forever in Mule 4 vs.
* TODO: Mule 3 Spring properties? (see File connector in Mule 3, for example.)
* TODO? Metadata changes: No Session variables. Outbound properties? Inbound properties Input attributes? FlowVars are now variables.
* Using message properties and attributes
* TODO: Message builders vs outbound properties: Short description here.
* TODO? Embedding DW inside operations
* TODO? New Error Handling. Error Mapping in Mule 4.

* New Watermark: MG says there's a new boolean in some core connectors to enable the watermark. Watermark is new to Cloud connectors though (talk to MNC). Core connectors are FTP/SFTP, VM, File by Mule 4 GA, and DB soon after that.
** Cover this, too? Some Mule4 compliant connectors (which lack watermark switch) might support watermark as described in old Object Store spec.
* Remove transformers
* Transports vs. connectors
