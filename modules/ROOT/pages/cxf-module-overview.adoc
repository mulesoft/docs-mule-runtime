[WARNING]
====
When sending requests to an external web service, the recommended approach is to use the xref:web-service-consumer.adoc[Web Service Consumer] rather than the CXF Module.
====

The CXF web services support inside Mule allows you to build sophisticated web service applications and do things like:

* Implement JAX-WS code first or WSDL first services
* Consume WSDL based web services
* Create proxies which mediate SOAP messages to:
** Create a WS-Security web service on a SOAP gateway
** Do content based routing
** Validate incoming requests against the WSDL
* Build reliable web services using WS-Addressing and WS-ReliableMessaging and a JDBC store.
* Build secure services which are transport agnostic using WS-Security and WS-SecureConversation.
* Configure services using WS-Policy

For information about what standards are supported, see xref:supported-web-service-standards.adoc[Supported Web Service Standards].

When using CXF inside of Mule, there are several different ways to build and consume service:

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Frontend Mode |Server |Client
|Simple |*<simple-service>* builds services based on simple POJOs - no annotations are needed. CXF will introspect your POJOs and generated a WSDL for them |*<simple-client>* allows you to interact with a service which was built with the simple frontend if you have a copy of the service interface.
|JAX-WS |*<jaxws-service>* builds a web service message processor which using the JAX-WS and JAXB standard annotations or from a set of classes generated from a WSDL. These annotations give you complete control over how your schemas and WSDL are generated. |*<jaxws-client>* builds a message processor which can operate in two modes: 1) it can use a JAX-WS client generated from WSDL. 2) it can use a JAX-WS service interface which matches your server interface.
|Proxy |*<proxy-service>* provides raw SOAP and WS-* processing for incoming XML messages, allowing you to apply things like WS-Security to incoming messages and work with the raw XML. |*<proxy-client>* provides raw SOAP and WS-* processing for outgoing XML messages, allowing you to send outgoing messages in raw XML form and apply things like WS-Security to them.
