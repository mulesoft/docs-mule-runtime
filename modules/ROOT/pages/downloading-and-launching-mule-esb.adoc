. http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-open-source-esb[image:studio.png[]]Before installing Mule ESB, be sure to install one of the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Development Kits] on your host machine:  +

* Java SE Development Kit Standard Edition 1.6.0_26 (also known as Java SE 6 Update 26)
* Java SE Development Kit 7 (also known as Java SE 7u13)
+
Running Studio on a Mac?
. Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path in which you installed the JDK.
. Visit http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-open-source-esb[mulesoft.com] to download **Mule ESB Enterprise with Mule Studio. **
. Click to download the Mule ESB product that is compatible with your operating system: Windows, Mac or Linux.
. Unzip the downloaded file to a directory on a hard drive located on your host machine.  The *Mule Studio* folder or directory appears when the unzip operation completes.

[WARNING]
====
Running Studio on a Mac?

If you're using Mac OS X Mountain Lion, there are two extra consideration to be mindful of when running Mule Studio.

==== Java Runtime Environment

Check to confirm that Java runtime environment 6 or 7 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app), run: ` java -version`

The response should appear similar to the following:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_43-b01-447-11M4203)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.14-b01-447, mixed mode)
----

If a Java runtime environment is _not_ installed, the command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK 6 or 7.

==== Application Execution

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Mule Studio _outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Mule Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. (Note: you must have Administrator privileges to adjust the security settings.)

. On your Mac, open *System Preferences*, then navigate to **Security & Privacy**.
. In the *General* tab, under "Allow applications downloaded from:" select the radio button for *Anywhere*.
