Splitters are not available in Mule runtime engine (Mule) 4. To process a collection of elements sequentially, use the xref:for-each-scope-concept.adoc[For Each component].

xref:connectors::aggregator/aggregators-module.adoc[Aggregators] remain in Mule 4 but as a separate module with very different behavior.

== Splitters

The main difference between Mule 3 splitters and the Mule 4 For Each component is that the `foreach` element is a scope, meaning that the components used to process the iterated elements must be defined within `foreach`.

.Mule 3 Example
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flow">
    ...
    <collection-splitter/>
    <component-1/>
    <component-2/>
    ...
    <component-n>
</flow>
----

.Mule 4 Example
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flow">
    ...
    <foreach>
        <component-1/>
        <component-2/>
        ...
        <component-n>
    </foreach>
</flow>
----

Also, the `foreach` element does not return a collection with the results of all the processed values. Instead, it returns the same collection received as input. So, the behavior of previous examples is not the same.

It does not matter if a Mule 3 aggregator is present. To store the results of the processed values, you need to use a Mule 4 aggregator.

=== Simple Migration

The default format of a migration:

.Mule 3 Example
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flow">
    ...
    <collection-splitter/>
    <component-1/>
    <component-2/>
    ...
    <component-n>
    <collection-aggregator/>
</flow>
----

.Mule 4 Example
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flow">
    ...
    <set-variable variableName="collection-splitter0-group-size" value="#[sizeOf(payload)]"/>
    <foreach>
        <component-1/>
        <component-2/>
        ...
        <component-n>
        <aggregators:group-based-aggregator name="collection-splitter0-aggregator"
                                            groupSize="#[vars.collection-splitter0-group-size]"
                                            evictionTime="0">
            <aggregators:aggregation-complete>
                <set-variable variableName="aggregation0" value="#[payload]"/>
            </aggregators:aggregation-complete>
        </aggregators:group-based-aggregator>
    </foreach>
    <set-payload value="#[vars.aggregation0]"/>
</flow>
----

In the example:

* A variable `collection-splitter0-group-size` is created to store the size of the collection. This is needed because inside the `foreach` scope, the payload corresponds to the element from the collection being processed.
* Every component between the `collection-splitter` and `collection-aggregator` is wrapped inside a `foreach` scope.
* A `group-based-aggregator` is added at the end of the `foreach` scope to store all the results. The size of the aggregation expected will correspond to the value stored in the `collection-splitter0-group-size` variable. `set-variable` is added inside the `aggregation-complete` to store the result of the aggregation once it is complete.
* Since the payload after the `foreach` element will be the same as the input received, `set-payload` should be used to set it as the stored value in the variable defined insider the `aggregation-complete` route.

[[complex_migration]]
=== Complex Migration

In some cases, the Mule 3 configuration with splitters and aggregators might set more parameters, so the migration will be a bit more complicated to achieve the Mule 3 behavior in Mule 4.

Mule 3 aggregators allowed for 2 attributes to be configured: `timeout` and `failOnTimeout`. If the `timeout` attribute is present (with a value greater than 0), the migration should be as follows in the examples.

[IMPORTANT]
Even when there is a way of adding extra logic when there is a timed-out aggregation and `failOnTimeout` is set to `true`, the behavior is not the same as in Mule 3. Aggregators in Mule 4 do not raise any errors or dispatch any notifications when there is a timed-out aggregation.


.Mule 3 Example
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flow">
    ...
    <collection-splitter/>
    <component-1/>
    <component-2/>
    ...
    <component-n>
    <collection-aggregator timeout="1000" failOnTimeout="false"/>
</flow>
----

.Mule 4 example
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<vm:config name="splitter-aggregator-vm-config">
    <vm:queues>
        <vm:queue queueName="collection-splitter0-vm-queue"/>
    </vm:queues>
</vm:config>
...
<flow name="flow">
    ...
    <set-variable variableName="collection-splitter0-group-size" value="#[sizeOf(payload)]"/>
    <set-variable variableName="collection-splitter0-aggregator-complete-aggregation" value="#[false]"/>
    <foreach>
        <component-1/>
        <component-2/>
        ...
        <component-n>
        <aggregators:group-based-aggregator name="collection-splitter0-aggregator"
                                            groupSize="#[vars.collection-splitter0-group-size]"
                                            timeout="1000"
                                            timeoutUni="MILLISECONDS"
                                            evictionTime="0">
            <aggregators:aggregation-complete>
                <set-variable variableName="collection-splitter0-aggregator-complete-aggregation" value="#[true]"/>
            </aggregators:aggregation-complete>
        </aggregators:group-based-aggregator>
    </foreach>
    <vm:consume queueName="collection-splitter0-vm-queue" config-ref="splitter-aggregator-vm-config"/>
    <choice>
        <when expression="#[vars.collection-splitter0-aggregator-complete-aggregation == false]">
            <!--place to add logic for when an aggregation timed out and the failOnTimeout flag was true-->
        </when>
    </choice>
</flow>

<flow name="collection-splitter0-aggregator-listener-flow">
    <aggregators:aggregator-listener aggregatorName="collection-splitter0-aggregator" includeTimedOutGroups="true"/>
    <vm:publish config-ref="splitter-aggregator-vm-config" queueName="collection-splitter0-vm-queue"/>
</flow>
----

In the example:

* A variable `collection-splitter0-group-size` should be created to store the size of the collection. This is needed because inside the `foreach` scope, the payload will correspond to the element from the collection being processed.
* Another variable `collection-splitter0-aggregator-complete-aggregation` should be created if there is a need for storing an indication of whether or not the aggregation terminated due to a timeout or a complete processing.
* Every component between the `collection-splitter` and `collection-aggregator` is wrapped inside a `foreach` scope.
* A `group-based-aggregator` is added at the end of the `foreach` scope to store all the results.
The expected size of the aggregation will correspond to the value stored in the `collection-splitter0-group-size` variable.
The timeout for the aggregation should be set to the timeout that the Mule 3 aggregator contained. `set-variable` is added inside the `aggregation-complete` to set that the aggregation was complete. (That route is only executed with a complete aggregation).
+
Another flow should be created and an `aggregator:aggregator-listener` should be added as source. All aggregations (complete or not) will trigger that listener. Then, they will be sent to the main flow via a `vm:publish` operation.
+
* A `vm:consume` operation is added after the `foreach` element to wait for the aggregation. Once a value is read, the flow will continue with its execution.
* Because the `collection-splitter0-aggregator-complete-aggregation` will only be set to true if the aggregation completes, additional logic can be added to check the value of that variable (with `choice` and `when`). This can simulate logic that was previously added in a Mule 3 error handler for when a timeout error was received.

=== Additional Attributes

All splitters allowed for the configuration of the `enableCorrelation` attribute.

There is no way to migrate an `enableCorrelation="NEVER"` configuration. A correlation ID is always set to the events processed from the collection by the `foreach` element.

Expression splitters (`<splitter/>`) allowed for the configuration of two attributes: `evaluator` and `custom-evaluator`. Expression evaluators can't be configured in Mule 4; only DataWeave can be used.

=== Available Splitters Migration

Mule 3 had the following splitters, some of which require some extra logic to be migrated or cannot be migrated at all.

* `collection-splitter`: As defined in the main example.
* `custom-splitter`: The use of custom classes is not allowed in Mule 4 anymore so this splitter can't be migrated.
* `splitter` (expression splitter) : The expression used should be set as the `collection` attribute for the `foreach` element.
** Mule 3: `<splitter expression="#[payload.someKey]"/>`
** Mule 4: `<foreach collection="#[payload.someKey]">`
* `map-splitter` : The DataWeave expression `#[dw::core::Objects::entrySet(payload)]` should be used as the `collection` attribute in the `foreach` element.
** Mule 3: `<map-splitter/>`
** Mule 4: `<foreach collection="#[dw::core::Objects::entrySet(payload)]">`
* `message-chunk-splitter`: There is no similar behavior in Mule 4, so it can't be migrated.

=== Aggregators

Most parameters allowed by Mule 3 aggregators are not allowed in Mule 4:

* `timeout` can be set in any new aggregator, however there are some differences. First, `timeoutUnit` should also be set to specify the unit of time. Also, the behavior of aggregation timeouts is very different in a Mule 4 aggregator. This is explained in xref:connectors::aggregator/aggregators-module-reference.adoc[Aggregators Module Reference].
* `failOnTimeout`: is not available in Mule 4. However, similar behavior can be achieved as explained in <<complex_migration>>.
* `processed-groups-object-store-ref` isn't stored in a separate object store in Mule 4, so this parameter isn't allowed in Mule 4.
* `event-groups-object-store-ref`can be set using the `objectStore` attribute in Mule 4 aggregators.
* `persistentStores` isn't allowed in Mule 4. If a persistent object store is needed, the `objectStore` attribute should be the name of a persistent object store.
* `storePrefix` isn't allowed in Mule 4.


=== Available Aggregators Migration

* `collection-aggregator` should be migrated as defined in the main example.
* `custom-aggregator` can't be migrated. You can't add custom implementations for an interface in Mule 4.
* `message-chunk-aggregator` can't be migrated to Mule 4 because there is no similar behavior.
