[[short_description]]
Flow and Subflow scopes are components for grouping together and executing a sequence Mule components and connector operations within a Mule application. The All Mule applications must contain at least one Flow component. Additional flows and subflows are optional.

.Example: Flow with Subflows
image::component-flow-subflow.png[Example of Flow with Subflows]

Flows and subflows process Mule events synchronously. To achieve
asynchronous patterns, such as Fire-and-Forget, you can add the
xref:async-scope-reference.adoc[Async scope] (`<async/>`) within a Flow a
Subflow scope.

For a more in-depth discussion of uses, capabilities, and limits of flows and
subflows, see xref:about-flows.adoc[Flows and Subflows].


== Reference

Flows are configurable. For example, you can set them to start or remained
stopped when the Mule application starts, place limits on the allowed concurrency, or set up business events. You can also set up error handling for a component (see <<error_handling>>).

The XML for a flow that sets values for all available attributes looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<flow name="flow_component_ex" tracking:enable-default-events="true"
      initialState="started" maxConcurrency="1">

  // Processors here

</flow>
----

[%header,cols="1a,1a,4a"]
|===
| Field Name | XML | Description
| Name | `name` | Name for the flow. Flows automatically receive an editable name that matches (or partially matches) the project name.
| Initial State | `initialState` | Accepts the following Mule runtime settings for the flow: `started` (default) or `stopped`. The setting `initialState="started"` indicates that the flow can be triggered by an internal or external event source within the flow (such as an HTTP listener or Scheduler), by a Flow Reference from another flow or subflow, or through a call to the xref:dataweave::dataweave-runtime-functions.adoc#functions_runtime[lookup] function.

If you set the initial state to `stopped`, you can use xref:runtime-manager::flow-management.adoc[Runtime Manager] to activate the flow in an application that is deployed to CloudHub, or you can reset the Flow configuration to `started` from Studio when developing the application. The Studio console for the `stopped` state prints a message like this one: `Flow flow_component_ex has not been started (initial state = 'stopped')`
| Max Concurrency (`maxConcurrency`) a| Optional. Sets the maximum number of concurrent messages that a flow can process. If not set, the container thread pool determines the maximum number of threads the flow can use to optimize the performance when processing messages. While the flow is processing the maximum number of concurrent messages, it cannot receive additional requests.

Set `maxConcurrency` to `1` to cause the flow to process requests one at a time.

See xref:execution-engine.adoc#backpressure[Back-pressure] for details about Mule's behavior after the the maximum concurrency value is reached.
| Business Events  a| Optional: Defaults to `false`. For Mule applications that you deploy to CloudHub, you can enable business events (XML example: `tracking:enable-default-event="true"`) and add a Transaction ID (XML example: `<tracking:transaction id=12345`/>). See xref::business-events.adoc[Business Events].
| Metadata  | As with many other components, you can set metadata for this component. For more on this topic, see the Studio document xref:7.1@studio::metadata-editor-concept.adoc[Metadata Editor].
|===

== Subflow Configuration

Subflow scopes provide a way to edit the name of the subflow and to add metadata. Unlike flows, subflows lack a built-in mechanism for setting up error handling, though you can use error handling provided by the xref:try-scope-concept.adoc[Try Scope] within a subflow if you need to perform error handling.

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
| Field | Description
| Name (`name`) | Name for the subflow. Subflows automatically receive an editable name that matches (or partially matches) the project name.
| Metadata  | As with many other components, you can set up metadata for this component. For more on this topic, see the Studio document xref:7.1@studio::metadata-editor-concept.adoc[Metadata Editor].

== Example

This example shows the XML for a flow  (`<flow/>`) that uses a Scheduler as a source to trigger execution of
the flow every 10 seconds, and it connects to a subflow (`<sub-flow/>`) through a Flow Ref (`<flow-ref/>`) component. That
subflow then connects to another subflow, also using a Flow Ref component. Note
that when you configure components through the Studio UI, Studio automatically adds the XML to the Configuration XML for your Mule application.

<sub-flow name="subflow_ex1">

    <ee:message>
      <ee:set-payload><![CDATA[%dw 2.0
import * from dw::util::Timer

var conversionRate=13
---
priceList: payload.prices mapObject(value, key, index) -> {
  (key) : {
       dollars: value,
       localCurrency: value * conversionRate,
       index_plus_1: index + 1,
       timer : currentMilliseconds()
   }
}]]>
      </ee:set-payload>
   </ee:message>
 </ee:transform>
 <flow-ref name="subflow_ex2"/>
</sub-flow>
<sub-flow name="subflow_ex2">
  <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Logger" message="#[payload]" />
</sub-flow>
----

The example produces the following output:

.Output
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "priceList": {
    "basic": {
      "dollars": "9.99",
      "localCurrency": 129.87,
      "index_plus_1": 1,
      "timer": 1533024312658
    },
    "premium": {
      "dollars": "53",
      "localCurrency": 689,
      "index_plus_1": 2,
      "timer": 1533024312659
    },
    "vip": {
      "dollars": "398.99",
      "localCurrency": 5186.87,
      "index_plus_1": 3,
      "timer": 1533024312659
    }
  }
}

[[error_handling]]
== Error Handling

You can add xref:error-handling.adoc[error handlers] to the Flow components (but not to subflows).

In Studio, you can simply expand the Error Handling area at the bottom of the Flow component and drag the error components into the flow. Note that this process automatically places the component into the Error Handler component, so there is no need to add the Error Handler component first.

Near the end of this XML example, the flow shows an On Error Continue configuration (`<on-error-continue/>`):

.Example: XML for Flow with On Error Continue Configuration
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flow_subflowFlow" >
  <scheduler doc:name="Scheduler" >
    <scheduling-strategy >
      <fixed-frequency frequency="10" timeUnit="SECONDS"/>
    </scheduling-strategy>
  </scheduler>
  <ee:transform doc:name="Transform Message" >
    <ee:message >
      <ee:set-payload ><![CDATA[
 %dw 2.0
 var myXml =  read('<prices></prices>', 'application/xml')
 output application/xml
 ---
 myXml
]]></ee:set-payload>
    </ee:message>
  </ee:transform>
  <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Logger" message='#[payload.prices]'/>
  <error-handler >
    <on-error-continue enableNotifications="true" logException="true" doc:name="On Error Continue" type="EXPRESSION" when="#[isEmpty(payload.prices)]">
      <logger level="ERROR" doc:name="Logger" message='"An Error Occurred"'/>
    </on-error-continue>
  </error-handler>
</flow>
----

The preceding example produces an error. Notice the following:

. The variable `var myXml` in `<set-payload/>` configures an empty `<prices></prices>` tag as the payload.
. The Logger beside the `<set-payload/>` component returns `null` because it is set to log the value of the empty tag.
. The `<on-error-continue/>` component returns an error because the DataWeave condition `isEmpty(payload.prices)` returns `true`.
. The Logger (`<logger/>`) within `<on-error-continue/>` configures an error message to print to the console when an error occurs. The resulting error message looks something like this:

[source,text,linenums]

//TODO: WOULD BETTER TO HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A FLOW THAT USES THE ERROR SCOPES.
