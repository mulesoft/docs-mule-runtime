By default, the DataWeave code from a Transform Message component is expressed inline within your Mule XML file. You can instead keep each in a separate file ( `.dwl` ) and have your XML reference them. These files are packaged with your Mule application when built.

To export the DataWeave code to a `.dwl` file:


. Click the *Edit Current Target* button.
+
image::dw-multiple-outputs-edit.png["An edit icon in the Transform Message component"]
. Select the *File* radio button.
+
image::dataweave-externalfile2.png["A target output payload with an option to choose a source code"]
* Type a name for your `.dwl` file.
* Click *OK*.

A file is created under the `src/main/resources` folder in your project containing your DataWeave code.
