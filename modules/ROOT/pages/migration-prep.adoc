Mule 4 introduces many changes, so plan accordingly before attempting to migrate from Mule 3.

[[when_to_start]]
== When to Start Using Mule 4

We recommend that you develop all *new* projects on Mule 4, provided that:

* You and your team have updated your skills for Mule 4 via the documentation or formal training.
* You have the proper deployment environment (see below).
* You do not require all applications to be on a single version of Mule (see below).

For projects which are already in development or deployed on Mule 3 (whether a prospect or customer), we recommend you wait to migrate these applications until the Mule 3 to Mule 4 migration tool is available. However, you can follow this guide to migrate manually.

Migrate your applications if any one of the following conditions is met:

* The 3.x version you're using reaches end of life
* You want to make significant updates to the existing applications
* You want to take advantage of key Mule 4 capabilities
* You decide to upgrade all their apps to Mule 4 because you require all apps to be on one version (some onprem customers)

[[prepare_dev_environ]]
== Setting up Your Local Development Environment

First, you will need to download Studio 7 and install it. If you're deploying locally, you will also need to download the Mule 4 standalone runtime.

[[prepare_to_deploy]]
== Getting Ready to Deploy
Next, you need to make sure your deployment environment is ready. Depending on which environment you have, different steps may be required.
