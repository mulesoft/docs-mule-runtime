An Event Source (or Trigger) is the first event processor in a flow. It receives a triggering event and creates a corresponding Mule event object to forward to the next component (or event processor) in the flow.

== Event Source (or Trigger) examples

* HTTP Request
* JMS message
* Salesforce publish
* File poller
* Scheduler
and more

You can also create your own event source using the Mule SDK.
