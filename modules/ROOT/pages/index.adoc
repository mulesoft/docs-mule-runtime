Mule runtime engine (Mule) is a lightweight integration engine that runs Mule apps.
Rather than creating multiple point-to-point integrations between systems,
services, APIs, and devices, Mule apps manage message routing, data mapping,
orchestration, reliability, security, and scalability between nodes.

With Mule you can:

* Connect data to apps in ESB patterns.
* Build APIs.
* Access, query, and transform data through the DataWeave language.
* Configure high-availability, clustering, and performance management at scale.
* Deploy an integration worker, ESB or API gateway, on-premises or in the cloud.
* Automatically manage thread pools with the self-tuning, reactive Mule runtime engine.
* Use error constructs and try scopes for rapid debugging.
* Isolate the classloader to protect Mule apps from changes to the runtime or connectors.

== Event-Driven Architecture

Mule works by responding to events that are initiated by external or internal
resources. Mule works with a variety sources, including listeners for external
events, and schedulers for internally triggered events.

Mule processes events as messages through Event processors. Mule can also
handle a high volume of messages in batches through Batch processors.

This behavior reflects Mule's event-driven architecture (EDA). For more
on this topic, see xref:about-mule-event.adoc[Mule Events].

[[flows]]
== Flows

Within a Mule app, event processing components are arranged into one or
more container-like components, called flows.

Understanding basic flow architecture is key to understanding Mule.
Essentially, every Mule flow contains a series of components that
receive or process messages.

.Simple Flow in Design Center

At the simplest level, flows are sequences of Event processors. A message
that enters a flow can pass through a variety of processors. In a typical
flow, a Mule app receives a message through an Event source (such as an
HTTP listener), transforms that message into a new format, and processes
any business logic before writing the processed message to an external
system in a format that the system can read.

To break up processing into more manageable units, Mule apps often contain
multiple, interrelated flows, instead of just a single flow. A flow can call
another flow as a direct reference.

For more on this topic, see xref:about-flows.adoc[Flows and Subflows] and
xref:mule-application-about.adoc[Mule Applications].

== Event Sources

An Event source (or trigger) is the first component in a flow. It
receives a triggering event, creates a corresponding Mule event object,
and forwards that event on for processing by the next component in the flow.

External clients can trigger processing in a Mule flow through a number of
communication protocols and methods, such as JMS, HTTP, FTP, JDBC, or File.
Mule translates these communication protocols and methods into a standard
Message format, which passes through the flow's Event processors.

Event sources in Mule can connect to specific external sources, either through
a standard protocol or a third-party API. It is also possible to set a Scheduler.
Some schedulers can poll for specific changes to external resources, such as new files
or table rows in an external resource. Examples of listeners and connector operations
that can trigger a flow include these:

* HTTP, JMS, VM listeners in their associated connectors
* On Table Row operation in the Database connector
* On New or Updated File operation in the File and FTP connectors
* Scheduler

Note that you can also create your own Event source using the
xref:1.1@mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK].

== Event Processors

Once a flow is triggered through an Event source, subsequent components process
the Mule event as it travels through the flow. By default, each Event processor
that receives a Mule event returns a new Mule message, typically with a set
of attributes and the message payload that the processor returns. The processor
passes on the new message as output to the next processor in the flow.

Event processors available to Mule apps include these:

* Operations from modules and connectors. Examples include reading from and
writing to an external resource and validating data in the Mule app.
+
Some operations can make client requests to external resources and services
(including external databases and systems, such as Salesforce, Workday,
ServiceNow, and many others) and to other Mule apps. Others can run your
custom code, support OAuth configurations, and handle communication through
asynchronous queues, for example. A variety of other operations are
available.
+
* Core components can route data, perform data transformations, handle errors
that might occur when processing the event, and perform other tasks in a
Mule app.
+
Transformers (such as the Transform Message, Set Variable, and others) are
key to exchanging data between nodes. Transformers enable Mule to convert
message data in the Mule event to a format that another app or service can
read.
+
Mule also enables content enrichment of messages (through
xref:target-variables.adoc[Target Parameters]) so that you can retrieve
additional data and attach it to the message.

Note that you can also create your own Event processors using the
xref:1.1@mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK].

and xref:connectors::index.adoc[Connectors and Modules].

=== Anypoint Studio and Design Center

You can design Mule apps in Anypoint Studio, in Design Center, or even with
handwritten XML. Studio and Design Center UIs represent message processors as
icons within flow components. Studio also represents them as XML elements in a
Configuration XML.

The example below is a simple flow created in Anypoint Studio's visual editor;
click the *XML Editor* tab to view the XML of a Mule project that holds the same
flow.

and xref:7.2@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio].

[[dataweave]]
== DataWeave

DataWeave is the primary language used for formulating expressions in Mule.
Within fields of many message processing components, in addition to the
Transform Message component, you can use DataWeave to access, manipulate,
transform, and extract data from the Mule event.

At runtime, Mule evaluates expressions while executing a flow to:

* Extract data needed to process the current message.
* Set or manipulate a value in the message.

For more on this topic, see xref:dataweave.adoc[DataWeave Language].

== Batch Processing

Mule supports batch jobs, which split messages into individual records,
act on each record, then report the results and, if necessary, push the processed
output to other systems or queues. This functionality is particularly useful when
working with streaming input or when engineering "near real-time" data integration
between SaaS applications.

Studio and Design Center provide various batch components that you can use to
configure batch processes. For more on this topic, see
xref:batch-processing-concept.adoc[Batch Processors].

== Non-blocking Execution Engine

The Mule execution engine is based on a non-blocking runtime. This is a
task-oriented execution model that allows you to take advantage of non-blocking
IO calls and to make tuning configurations in a simple way.

Flows always function synchronously. If you need to achieve asynchronous
patterns, such as Fire-and-Forget, you can use the xref:async-scope-reference.adoc[Async (`<async>`)] component.

Mule Event processors indicate to the runtime whether they are CPU intensive,
CPU light, or IO intensive operations. These workload types help the runtime tune
for different workloads, removing the need for you to manage thread pools manually
to achieve optimum performance. Instead, the runtime introspects the available
resources (such as memory and CPU cores) in the system to tune thread pools
automatically.

For more detailed documentation on the execution engine, threading model, and 
tuning options, see xref:execution-engine.adoc[Execution Engine].

////
Generally speaking, event processing components process business logic, such as
checking customer and inventory databases. These components route messages to the
correct application, such as an order fulfillment system. Importantly,
event processors do not necessarily require Mule-specific code. For example,
MuleSoft provides event processing components that support POJOs, Spring beans,
Java beans, Groovy scripts, and web services that contain the business logic
for processing data. It is also possible to develop custom modules to
support other languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Ruby, or PHP. MuleSoft's
catalog event processing components support the most commonly used
Enterprise Integration Patterns.
+
Some event processors provide ways to filter source data (such as files or
email) so that you only deal with the data that your use cases require. Some
event processors also serve as scopes that "wrap" around other event
processors and cache the result of their processing. You can use routers to
send messages on different paths in your app, depending on the content of
the message payload.
