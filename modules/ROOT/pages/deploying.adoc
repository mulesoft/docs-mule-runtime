[NOTE]
This section deals with deploying to standalone instances of the Mule Runtime. To take full advantage of managing and monitoring features, you can deploy to the same Mule runtime via the Runtime Manager.

Mule standalone can run multiple applications. This means you can include the same name spaces within different applications and they neither collide nor share information.

In effect, Mule is an app server. Mule checks for new apps (in the `apps` directory) and starts them.

Mule also restarts apps if it detects that the apps have changed, meaning you can drop a revised version of an existing, running application into the `/apps` directory, Mule stops the existing app and restarts using the new files.
