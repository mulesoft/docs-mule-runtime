Mule standalone can run multiple applications. This means you can include the same name spaces within different applications and they neither collide nor share information.

In effect, Mule is an app server. Mule checks for new apps (in the apps directory) and starts them.

Mule also restarts apps if it detects that the apps have changed, meaning you can drop a revised version of an existing, running application into the /apps directory, Mule stops the existing app and restarts using the new files.

If Mule is embedded in another container, the https://docs.archive.mulesoft.com/mule-management-console/v/3.7/[Mule Management Console] cannot perform Autodiscovery or server restarts.
