The Mule Enterprise transport for IBM® WebSphere® MQ (Mule WMQ transport) provides the following functionality:

* Bi-directional request-response messaging between Websphere MQ and Mule JMS using native MQ point-to-point.
* Synchronous and asynchronous request-response communications using JMSReplyTo.
* Support for local, multi-resource, and XA transactions
* Support for native MQ message types
* WebSphere MQ-specific configuration syntax that removes the complexity of MQ configuration
* Supports async request-response messaging pattern transparently in both JMS and native MQ message types
* Support for connection retry policies (self-healing) with or without transactions
* Support for IBM-specific headers
* JNDI destination support including JNDI connections
* Per endpoint control over target clients (native or JMS compliant)
* Certified on WMQ v6 and WMQ v7 (use WebSphere MQ 6.0.2.8 client JARs in both cases)

This page describes how to configure and use this transport and its connector. It assumes that you already understand how to configure and use WebSphere MQ. For complete information on WebSphere MQ, refer to the http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/index.jsp[WebSphere MQ Information Center].

The Mule WMQ transport is available only with Mule Enterprise Edition version 1.6 or later and, as of 2.2, contains many critical performance and reliability improvements as well as native support for WebSphere MQ-specific features.

*Note*: The community JMS transport does not provide full support for WebSphere MQ and is not recommended for use with production WebSphere MQ installations.

== Setting Up the Mule WMQ Transport

In Mule 2.x, before you can use the Mule WMQ transport, you must copy the following JARs from the `java/lib` directory under your WebSphere MQ home directory into the `lib/user` directory under your Mule home directory:

* `com.ibm.mq.jar`
* `com.ibm.mqetclient.jar` (if using remote XA transactions)
* `com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar` (WebSphere MQ version 7 only)
* `com.ibm.mqjms.jar`
* `dhbcore.jar`

Additionally, if you are using local bindings (`transportType="BINDINGS_MQ"`), you must set the following environment variable:

[source,text,linenums]
----
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/mqm/java/lib
----

Set this variable to the location of the Java library directory that shipped with the WebSphere MQ server installation. For more information about the bindings types, see the WebSphere MQ documentation.

== Schema

* WMQ Schema: http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/wmq/3.2/mule-wmq-ee.xsd

== Using the Mule WMQ Transport

By default, messages sent from Mule to WebSphere MQ are sent in native format, and JMS (RFH2) headers are suppressed. This configuration is applied transparently to the configuration below by the connector appending a parameter to the WebSphere MQ destination URI (`?targetClient=1`). To force JMS behavior on the receiving WebSphere MQ (that is, to use non-native format), use the following attribute setting in the WMQ connector declaration:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wmq:connector name="..."           ...      targetClient="JMS_COMPLIANT"          .../>
----

*Note:* The `targetClient` attribute must be set to `JMS_COMPLIANT` when the message payload is an object.

The following configuration example configures a service named `test` that performs request-reply processing. It picks up messages from the native WebSphere MQ endpoint (`wmq://REQUEST.QUEUE`) and forwards them to another native WebSphere MQ endpoint, `wmq://RESPONSE.QUEUE`. The `Responder` service waits while Mule processes the messages asynchronously and appends the string RESPONSE OK when it receives messages on the response queue. All JMS semantics apply, and settings such as replyTo and QoS properties are read from the message properties, or defaults are used (according to the JMS specification).

Note the following additional points about the configuration:

* The `wmq` URI scheme for endpoints indicates that the WebSphere MQ transport should be used.
* The `queueManager` property in the WMQ connector declaration matches the WebSphere MQ QueueManager set up previously.
* The local queues `REQUEST.QUEUE` and `RESPONSE.QUEUE` were set up previously using the `runmqsc` utility. If you were running on a remote queue, you could specify the channel with the `channel` attribute.

----

If you were running on a remote queue, you could use the WebSphere MQ utility `amqsget` to verify that the message was received on the remote queue.

== Defining WMQ XA Connector

Defining CF via Spring is optional, you ca simply define WMQ XA-enabled connector as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wmq:xa-connector ...>
----

It instantiates the XA CF under the hood, no reference to explicitly defined CF is required.

However, in some situations you need to define CF explicitly and then reference it in the connector definition. If that is the case, then the CF class has to be MQXAConnectionFactory, if XA transactions are used. Then WMQ connector has to reference this bean, for example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<spring:bean id="mqXAFactory" class="com.ibm.mq.jms.MQXAConnectionFactory">...</spring:bean><wmq:xa-connector ... connectionFactory-ref="mqXAFactory">
----

== Inbound Message Handling

The inbound messages are received by the connector and delivered to the component. If the `useRemoteQueueDefinitions` connector attribute is not set to true and the inbound message type is `MQMT_REQUEST`, the message returned by the component is sent to the queue specified in the `JMSReplyTo` property of the original message. However, if the outbound WebSphere MQ endpoint exists in the component, it overrides the replyto handler functionality. By default, `useRemoteQueueDefinitions` is set to false.

image::inbound-flow.png[]

== Outbound Message Handling

The outbound endpoint behavior depends on the WebSphere MQ message type. If the message type is `MQMT_REPLY` or `MQMT_DATAGRAM`, other properties copy over from the original message and the message dispatches to the queue.

If the message type is `MQMT_REQUEST`, the connector checks for the existence of the `JMSReplyTo` setting on the message. If it is not set, the temporary queue creates. If the endpoint is synchronous, the connector waits for a response. The timeout can be set using the `responseTimeout` setting. If a response is received by the connector, it is returned by the component.

image::outbound-flow.png[]

== Retrieving the Connection Factory from JNDI

To support the case where a JNDI registry has been configured to store the connection factory, the connector declaration should include the following parameters.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wmq:connector ...      jndiInitialFactory="com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory"     jndiProviderUrl="ldap://localhost:10389/"     connectionFactoryJndiName="cn=ConnectionFactory,dc=example,dc=com"
----

== Transformers

The WMQ transport provides a transformer for converting a `com.ibm.jms.JMSMessage` or sub-type into an object by extracting the message payload. It also provides a transformer to convert the object back to a message. You use the `<message-to-object-transformer>` and `<object-to-message-transformer>` elements to configure these transformers. Note that object payloads work only when `targetClient` is set to `JMS_COMPLIANT`.

== Transactions

You can configure single-resource (local), multi-resource, and XA transactions on WMQ transport endpoints using the standard transaction configuration elements. For example, you might configure an XA transaction on an outbound endpoint as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jbossts:transaction-manager/><wmq:xa-connector name="wmqConnector" hostName="winter" ...>...  <outbound>    <pass-through-router>      <wmq:outbound-endpoint queue="out">        <xa-transaction action="ALWAYS_BEGIN"/>      </wmq:outbound-endpoint>    </pass-through-router>  </outbound>...
----

Note that if you are using XA transactions, and you are connecting to a queue that requires the queue manager to connect to a remote resource, you must use the extended transactional client from WebSphere MQ (`mqetclient.jar`). For more information, see http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/cs10270_.htm[What is an extended transactional client?] in the WebSphere MQ 7 help.

For more information on using transactions, see xref:transaction-management.adoc[Transaction Management].

== Configuring Retry Policies

The WMQ transport supports xref:configuring-reconnection-strategies.adoc[retry policies]. As of Mule 2.2.3, you can configure the timeout value on the connector as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wmq:connector name="wmqConnector" ...>  <spring:property name="connectionLostTimeout" value="3000"/>  <ee:retry-forever-policy frequency="3000" /></wmq:connector>
----

The example that ships with the Mule WMQ transport allows you to test retry policies. For complete information, see the readme file in the WMQ distribution.

== Known Limitations

Following are the features that have not been fully tested with the Mule WMQ transport or are not supported:

* Remote queues (tested only in previous releases)
* Exit handler support (not tested)
* Topics (not tested)
* MQMT_REPORT message type support (not supported)
* Native WMQ connection pool support (not supported)
* SSL connection support (not supported)
* Data compression over channels for performance throughput gain (not supported)

|queue |string |yes |  |The queue name.
|disableTemporaryReplyToDestinations |boolean |no |  |If this is set to false (the default), when Mule performs request/response calls a temporary destination will automatically be set up to receive a response from the remote WMQ call.
|correlationId |string |no |  |A client can use the correlation ID header field to link one message to another. A typical use case is to link a response message with its request message. The CorrelationID must be a 24-byte String. WebSphere will pad shorter values with zeroes so that the fixed length is always 24 bytes. Because each message sent by a WMQ provider is assigned a message ID value, it is convenient to link messages via the message ID. All message ID values must start with the 'ID:' prefix.
|messageType |  |no |  |Indicates the message type. Each of the message types have specific behavior associated with them. The following message types are defined: MQMT_REQUEST: The message requires a reply. Specify the name of the reply queue using the <ReplyTo> element of outbound routers. Mule handles the underlying configuration. MQMT_DATAGRAM: The message does not require a reply. MQMT_REPLY: The message is the reply to an earlier request message (MQMT_REQUEST). The message must be sent to the queue indicated by the <ReplyTo> configured on the outbound router. Mule automatically configures the request to control how to set the MessageId and CorrelationId of the reply. MQMT_REPORT: The message is reporting on some expected or unexpected occurrence, usually related to some other message (for example, a request message was received that contained data that was not valid). Sends the message to the queue indicated by the <ReplyTo> configuration of the message descriptor of the original message.
|characterSet |integer |no |  |If set, this property overrides the coded character set property of the destination queue or topic.
|persistentDelivery |boolean |no |  |If set to true, the JMS provider logs the message to stable storage as it is sent so that it can be recovered if delivery is unsuccessful. A client marks a message as persistent if the application will have problems if the message is lost in transit. A client marks a message as non-persistent if an occasional lost message is tolerable. Clients use delivery mode to tell a JMS provider how to balance message transport reliability/throughput. Delivery mode only covers the transport of the message to its destination. Retention of a message at the destination until its receipt is acknowledged is not guaranteed by a PERSISTENT delivery mode. Clients should assume that message retention policies are set administratively. Message retention policy governs the reliability of message delivery from destination to message consumer. For example, if a client's message storage space is exhausted, some messages as defined by a site-specific message retention policy may be dropped. A message is guaranteed to be delivered once and only once by a JMS provider if the delivery mode of the message is persistent and if the destination has a sufficient message retention policy.
|timeToLive |long |no |  |Define the default length of time in milliseconds from its dispatch time that a produced message should be retained by the message system. Time to live is set to zero (forever) by default.
|priority |substitutablePriorityNumber |no |  |Sets the message priority. JMS defines a ten-level priority value with 0 as the lowest priority and 9 as the highest. In addition, clients should consider priorities 0-4 as gradations of normal priority and priorities 5-9 as gradations of expedited priority. JMS does not require that a provider strictly implement priority ordering of messages. However, it should do its best to deliver expedited messages ahead of normal messages.
|targetClient |  |no |  |Specifies whether this is in JMS or non-JMS format. Possible values are: JMS_COMPLIANT or NONJMS_MQ (default).
