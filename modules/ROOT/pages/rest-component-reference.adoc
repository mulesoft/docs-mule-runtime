*Purpose:* Use a REST API to publish an external RESTful web service.

*Minimum Configuration:* Specify the REST component or resource class.

A REST component publishes a RESTful web service via JAX-RS annotations and using Jersey. In addition to specifying the REST component class, you can also configure an exception mapper and a interceptor.

Note that REST is a formal HTTP architecture based on resources, links, and a uniform interface. As such, it uses the HTTP protocol.

Mule hosts RESTful web services using Jersey, which is a JAX-RS (JSR-311) implementation. JAX-RS is a specification that provides a series of annotations and classes that make it possible to build RESTful services.

Generally, you add a REST component to an connector. If you add the REST component to a request-response connector, such as an HTTP connector, Anypoint Studio generates a REST request-response component, as shown below.

If you add the REST component to a one-way connector, such as a File connector, then Anypoint Studio generates a REST one-way component.

Open the REST component's *Properties Editor*. Use the General tab to specify the reference to the REST component or resource and, if you are using exception mapping, the class implementing this mapping.
