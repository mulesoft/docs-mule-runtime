The Transform (or Transform Message) component converts input data to a new output structure or format. You can use the component's visual mapper to build your transformation implicitly by dragging and dropping elements of the incoming data structure, or you can explicitly write a transformation script in DataWeave expression language.

* Graphical View (Drag-and-Drop editor): Two tree views show the expected metadata structures of the input and output. Mappings between these two trees are represented by lines that connect input to output fields. The lines can be created by dragging and dropping an element from the input to another element to the output.

* Script View: The visual mapping can be represented as DataWeave code. Advanced transformations such as aggregation, normalization, grouping, joining, partitioning, pivoting and filtering can be coded here.

Note that changes in one view are reflected in real time with the other.

== Preview

A preview of your output is built on sample data (such as a JSON snippet) and is updated in real time as you make changes to your transformation.
