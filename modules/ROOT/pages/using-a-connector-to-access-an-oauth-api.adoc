Some Mule connectors make use of an OAuth security protocol to manage user identities. Use the authentication that you configure in a connector when your Mule app is sending requests to a service that requires authentication, such as the Github OAuth2 server. In this case, your Mule app is the client. On the other hand, when you want to protect your API or app from _receiving requests_ from unauthorized access, use an API Manager policy.

This document explains how to configure OAuth 2.0 features in a connector.

== Using a Connector with OAuth 2.0

To explain how to configure a connector to use OAuth 2.0, this document uses the example of building a Mule flow with an OAuth Salesforce connector.

=== Acquiring OAuth Tokens

To configure OAuth 2.0 in your connector, you must first acquire a *consumer key* and a *consumer secret* from the application to which you intend to connect. This procedure varies from one service provider to another, so look for the documentation provided by the software service provider.

The OAuth provider (in this case, Salesforce) asks that you provide a *callback URL*. The callback URL is the URL that the OAuth provider calls with the authorization tokens once authorization has been completed.  Remember the URL you set here, as it must match the one your application uses.

==== How to Get Your Consumer Key and Secret for Salesforce

. http://www.developerforce.com/events/regular/registration.php[Register for a Salesforce account].
. After completing the registration, click the link in the confirmation email to set a password, then log in to http://developer.force.com/[Salesforce Developer Edition].
. Configure your Salesforce account to be accessed from a remote application using OAuth. On the Salesforce Developer Edition UI, click the *Setup* link on the top rigth of the screen, next to your user name.
. Look for the *Connected Apps* section, and click the *New* button next to it to connect a new app
. Fill in the form for your application, be sure to enable the checkbox labeled *Enable OAuth* *Settings*. Then provide a callback URL and list the permissions that your API should obtain.
.  Click *Save*, then, on the following page, note the *consumer key* and *consumer secret*. You use these values to configure the connector to access Salesforce.

=== Configuring Your Connector

In your Mule application, create and configure new connector using the following pieces of data:

* Your consumer key
* Your consumer secret
* The OAuth callback URL

If you need to deploy to different environments (for example, production, development) where these parameters need to have different values, see xref:deploying-to-multiple-environments.adoc[Deploying to Multiple Environments].

==== Controlling Flow Processing

You can define the behavior of a connector for situations when a user with no OAuth token attempts to utilize the service (that is, the user is not yet authenticated via OAuth). Use the *On No Token* field to select one of the following two options.

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*STOP_FLOW* |Behaving like a filter, this option kills flow execution . This choice is ideal for keeping log files light as it doesn't create exceptions before you have had a chance to authorize your connector to access the OAuth provider.
|*EXCEPTION* |(_Default_) Throws an exception advising the user that an OAuth token is required.

== Creating an Authorization Flow

Before an end user application can perform any operations via the service provider's API, it must obtain authentication to do so. To make authentication possible, use an *authorization flow* in your Mule application. This authorization flow requests, then acquires authentication tokens from the OAuth provider. It  consists of an HTTP listener followed by a Salesforce connector which uses the global Salesforce (OAuth) element you created to perform the authorize operation with Salesforce.

=== Studio Visual Editor

. Drag processors onto the canvas to build a Mule flow. See the one below using the HTTP Listener and OAuth enabled Salesforce connector.
+

. Create a new connector configuration element for the HTTP connector, set the *Host* and *Port* to correspond to the callback URL that you set in your global element. (In the example, the callback URL is `http://localhost:8081/callback`.) In this case, also set the *Path* in the connector to `callback`.
. Click the Salesforce connector to open its properties editor, then use the drop-down *Connector Configuration* to select the global Salesforce connector element you configured for OAuth in the previous section.
. Configure any additional fields required by the connector. See below for configuration details for this example.

==== Scopes

Depending on the service provider, you may have the option to define scopes . A *scope* gives you access to perform a set of particular actions, such as viewing contacts, posting items, changing passwords, etc. The Salesforce connector does not use scopes.

Should a connectors require scope configuration, Studio includes the scopes as configurable fields in the properties editor. If the connector you wish to use makes use of scopes , refer to the http://www.mulesoft.org/connectors[connector's specific documentation] to determine which values are valid.

=== About the Authorization Flow

An end user initiates the authorization flow above by navigating to the HTTP Listener's address in a Web browser. When triggered, this flow starts the OAuth dance, directing the user to the service provider's login page. Mule also creates a *callback endpoint* so the service provider can direct the user back to the Mule flow once authenticated. The connector extracts information from the callback, sets its own internal state to _authorized_, then continues flow processing. Further, the connector automatically issues an *access token identifier* which Mule stores in the ObjectStore.

Mule manages access tokens automatically assigning a default value for the `accessTokenId` to match the name of the global connector configuration (in this example, the global Salesforce (OAuth) element). Using a default value allows  the connector to be authorized for many users. However, because CloudHub's ObjectStore functionality behaves slightly differently, if you run your project in *CloudHub in multitenancy mode*, then each access token identifier is unique for each user. Note that on all versions of Mule prior to *Mule Studio (October 2013)* with *CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013)*, you must perform a few https://docs.archive.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/using-a-connector-to-access-an-oauth-api[extra steps] to manage storage of the `accessTokenId`.

=== After Authentication

Add a `Logger` element to your flow after the connector set to the authorization operation. If the connector is not yet authorized, Mule delays execution of the logger until it receives a callback. On the other hand, if the user has already been authorized in a previous request and the connector already has its TokenId, then Mule continues flow execution and the logger executes immediately, rather than waiting for the callback.

== Managing OAuth Tokens

*Token IDs* are stored in an Object Store variable in the Mule environment. Optionally, you can define the name of this variable three different ways:

. using the connector configuration `name` (*_Default_*)
. using the expression set as the value of  `defaultAccessTokenId` attribute
+
image::box-default-access-token-id-field.png[]
. using the value of the `accessTokenId` attribute to set an operation

+

image::box-access-token-id-field.png[]

The following list explains each of these behaviors.

. Mule uses the connector's configuration name by default. If your configuration looks like the example below, the Object Store variable that keeps track of Token IDs also uses the name *Box_Connector*. This functionality is available whether running on CloudHub, or in single-tenant mode on premises.
+

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<box:config name="Box_Connector" clientId="123" clientSecret="123" doc:name="Box"  >
    <box:oauth-callback-config domain="localhost" localPort="8081" path="box_callback" remotePort="8082"/>
</box:config>

<flow name="BoxOauthFlow">
    <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/" doc:name="HTTP"/>
    <box:authorize config-ref="Box_Connector" doc:name="Box" accessTokenId="asda3gasdga24" accessTokenUrl="accesstokenurl" authorizationUrl="authurl" state="statevalue"/>

    <box:upload-stream config-ref="Box_Connector" filename="file" doc:name="Box"/>
</flow>
----
+

[WARNING]
====
When running on-premises implementations, leaving this variable's name to its default could lead to token overwriting when multiple users access the service. If you have ten users then you cannot store their ten unique Token IDs under the same variable name. In such a case, you must create new variables for each.

However, this issue does not manifest when running in multitenant mode on CloudHub. In CloudHub, each tenant gets its own separate Object Store partition which is completely unaccessible for other tenants. For example, if you have ten customers, those ten tokens are in different partitions of the Object Store and so keys don’t overlap.
====
+
. If you set the `defaultAccessTokenId` parameter in the connector configuration, Mule uses its value. You can set this parameter to an expression to avoid overwriting the Token ID.
