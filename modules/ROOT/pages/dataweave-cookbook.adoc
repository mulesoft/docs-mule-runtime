| xref:dataweave-cookbook-format-according-to-type.adoc[Format According to Type]
| Uses `mapObject` to apply changes to the keys in an object, depending on the type of their corresponding values. Uses `camelize`, `capitalize`, and `pluralize` depending on the `if` and `else if` statement.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-regroup-fields.adoc[Regroup Fields]
| Uses `groupBy`, `mapObject`, and `map` to reorganize JSON and XML fields.

| Uses `zip` to rearrange pairs of similar arrays so that they form a series of touples with the matching values from each.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-pick-top-elements.adoc[Pick Top Elements]
| Uses `groupBy` and `map` to sort a list of candidates according to their score at a test, then it splits the array to select only the top candidates.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-change-value-of-a-field.adoc[Change the Value of a Field]
| Masks sensitive data by changing values of some keys to asterisks (`\****``). Uses `mapObject`, `if`, and `else`.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-exclude-field.adoc[Exclude Fields from the Output]
| Shows how to exclude unwanted elements from the output. Uses the `-` (remove) and `mapObject` functions.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-use-constant-directives.adoc[Use Constant Directives]
| Defines a series of constant strings and numbers in the header, these are used to filter input and to concatenate into URLs. Uses `map`, `if` and `++` to concatenate strings.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-define-a-custom-addition-function.adoc[Define a Custom Addition Function]
| Defines a function that obtains totals and subtotals through the `accumulator` function. Also performs additions, subtractions, and multiplications of numeric values.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-flatten-arrays.adoc[Flatten Elements of Arrays]
| Uses `flatten`, the object constructor braces (`{}`), and selectors to flatten subarrays and nested elements in arrays.
Uses concatenation (`++`) to combine arrays before flattening them and uses
the `..*` descendants selector on a key to select values from a flattened list.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-define-function-to-flatten-list.adoc[Define a Function That Flattens Data in a List]
| Uses `reduce`, `map`, `if`, and `splitBy` to modify and conditionally output fields from a list.

| Shows uses of regular expressions in arguments to several DataWeave functions.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-output-self-closing-xml-tags.adoc[Output Self-closing XML Tags]
