|Example | Description

|xref:dataweave-cookbook-extract-data.adoc[Extract Data]
| Shows common selector expressions for extracting values from a data source, such as a Mule message.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-perform-basic-transformation.adoc[Transform XML to JSON] | Uses selectors to perform a basic format transformation. It does not use any functions.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-map.adoc[Mapping Data]
| Uses `map` to reorganize fields in a JSON array. It uses `as` to coerce a String into a Number.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-map-an-object.adoc[Map Objects]
| Uses `mapObject` to go through the keys and values in each object, and set all the keys to upper case.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-map-object-elements-as-an-array.adoc[Map Object Elements as an Array]
| Uses the multi-value selector to pick out the keys in an object that are named "book", these are returned as an array. It then uses `map` to iterate through the array this creates.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-rename-keys.adoc[Rename Keys]
| Renames some keys in a JSON object while retaining the names of all other keys in the output. Uses `mapObject`, `if`, `as`, and `and`.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-output-a-field-when-present.adoc[Output a Field When Present]
| Uses `if` with `map` to determine whether to include a field in the output. You might use it to exclude fields that contain sensitive data.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-format-according-to-type.adoc[Format According to Type]
| Uses `mapObject` to apply changes to the keys in an object, depending on the type of their corresponding values. Uses `camelize`, `capitalize`, and `pluralize` depending on the `if` and `else if` statement.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-regroup-fields.adoc[Regroup Fields]
| Uses `groupBy`, `mapObject`, and `map` to reorganize JSON and XML fields.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-zip-arrays-together.adoc[Zip Arrays Together]
| Uses `zip` to rearrange pairs of similar arrays so that they form a series of touples with the matching values from each.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-pick-top-elements.adoc[Pick Top Elements]
| Uses `groupBy` and `map` to sort a list of candidates according to their score at a test, then it splits the array to select only the top candidates.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-change-value-of-a-field.adoc[Change the Value of a Field]
| Masks sensitive data by changing values of some keys to asterisks (`\****``). Uses `mapObject`, `if`, and `else`.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-exclude-field.adoc[Exclude Fields from the Output]
| Shows how to exclude unwanted elements from the output. Uses the `-` (remove) and `mapObject` functions.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-use-constant-directives.adoc[Use Constant Directives]
| Defines a series of constant strings and numbers in the header, these are used to filter input and to concatenate into URLs. Uses `map`, `if` and `++` to concatenate strings.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-define-a-custom-addition-function.adoc[Define a Custom Addition Function]
| Defines a function that obtains totals and subtotals through the `accumulator` function. Also performs additions, subtractions and multiplications of numeric values.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-define-function-to-flatten-list.adoc[Define a Function that Flattens Data in a List]
| Uses `reduce`, `map`, `if`, and `splitBy` to modify and conditionally output fields from a list.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-output-self-closing-xml-tags.adoc[Output Self-closing XML Tags]
| Uses `inlineCloseOn="empty"` to close empty tags (for example, `<element2/>`).

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-insert-attribute.adoc[Insert an Attribute into an XML Tag]
| Uses the `@(key:value)` syntax to create an XML attribute.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-remove-certain-xml-attributes.adoc[Remove Specified XML Attributes]
| Defines a function that recursively checks an element and all of its children for a specific XML attribute and removes it with `-`. It also uses `mapObject`, `if` and `is` (to match types).


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-include-xml-namespaces.adoc[Include XML Namespaces]
| Defines multiple XML namespaces and references these in each tag.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-reference-multiple-inputs.adoc[Reference Multiple Inputs]
| References data on the payload, a message attribute and a variable. It then processes these through `map`, `filter` and multiplications.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-merge-multiple-payloads.adoc[Merge Multiple Payloads]
| Reference data that arrives in multiple separate payloads from one single Mule event. Filters the output based on a unique identifier. Uses `map`, `using`, `as`, and `filter` functions.


| xref:dataweave-cookbook-use-constant-directives.adoc[Use Constant Directives]
| Defines a `var` in the DataWeave header that builds URLs from constant directives using `++` to concatenate strings.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-parse-dates.adoc[Parse Dates]
| Defines a function that normalizes conflicting date formats into a single, common format. Uses `mapObject`, `replace` and `as` to coerce a data type.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-add-and-subtract-time.adoc[Add and Subtract Dates]
| Performs multiple math operations combining different types related to date and time.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-conditional-list-reduction-via-function.adoc[Conditionally Reduce a List through a Function]
| Defines a function that reduces a list of elements into one field. It then calls this function only when a certain field has values. Uses `map`, `reduce`, `splitBy`, `if` and `++` to append to an array.

| xref:dataweave-cookbook-map-based-on-an-external-definition.adoc[Dynamic Map Based On a Definition]
| Transforms the payload according to definitions sent in a variable. It defines a function that applies the logic defined in the variable, using `map` and `default`.

|  xref:dataweave-cookbook-pass-functions-as-arguments.adoc[Pass Functions as Arguments]
| Defines a function that expects to receive two inputs: a function to apply and an element to apply it on. The function is also recursively applied to the element's children. It uses `mapObject` `lower` `is` `if/else`.
