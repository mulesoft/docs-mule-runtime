= Troubleshoot Cryptography Module

To troubleshoot the Cryptography module, become familiar with app logs, PGP protocol, attached and detached signatures, and interpreting commonly thrown messages.

== View the App Log

If you encounter problems while running your Mule runtime engine (Mule) app, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file `log4j2.xml`, view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

== Enable Cryptography Module Debug Logging

To begin troubleshooting the Cryptography module, enable debug logging to see the exact error messages:

. Access Anypoint Studio and navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application by clicking the project name.
. Open the `src/main/resources` path folder.
. Open the `log4j2.xml` file inside the folder.
. Add the following line:
+
`<AsyncLogger name="com.mulesoft.modules.cryptography" level="DEBUG" />`

[start=6]
. Save your changes.
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.

== Understand PGP Encryption and Decryption Configuration

During PGP encryption, the sender of the message must encrypt its content using the receiver’s _public key_. To encrypt messages in your Mule app using someone else’s public key, in the *Crypto Pgp* global configuration add the _receiver_ public keyring file in the *Public keyring* field.

During PGP decryption, the receiver of the message must use its _private key_ to decrypt the contents of a message that was encrypted using a public key. To decrypt the message, in the *Crypto Pgp* global configuration add the _receiver_ private keyring file in the *Private keyring* field.

== Understand PGP Signature Configuration

In addition to encrypting, you can sign a message. The signature provides an integrity check of the original message.

To create a signature, in the *Crypto Pgp* global configuration add the _sender_ private keyring file in the *Private keyring* field.

To validate a signature, in the *Crypto Pgp* global configuration add the _sender_ public keyring file in the *Public keyring* field.

=== PGP Signature Types and Operations

The Cryptography module has two PGP signature operations:

* *Pgp sign*: Creates a PGP armored signature in ASCII format.
* *Pgp sign binary*: Creates a PGP binary signature.

In both cases, signing includes the private key of the sender, so the secret passphrase must be provided.

There are two types of signatures:

* Attached signature +
Generates a single document file that contains both the signature and the original document.

* Detached signature +
Generates a single document file that contains only the signature, which is stored and transmitted separately from the document the signature signs.

Currently, the Cryptography module supports validation of detached signatures only.

== Understand Common Throws

Here is a list of common throw messages and how to interpret them:

* CRYPTO:PARAMETERS

 The operation is configured using invalid parameters.

* CRYPTO:MISSING_KEY

 A key required for the operation was not found.

* CRYPTO:PASSPHRASE

 The unlocking password is invalid.

* CRYPTO:CHECKSUM

 An error occurred during an attempt to calculate a checksum.

* CRYPTO:TRANSFORMATION

 An error occurred during an attempt to transform binary to ASCII to build the ASCII Armor file.

* CRYPTO:VALIDATION

 The signature cannot be validated against the data.
