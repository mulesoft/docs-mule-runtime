In addition to using Anypoint Studio, Anypoint Runtime Manager, or the Anypoint Platform CLI to deploy applications to CloudHub, you can also deploy, redeploy, or undeploy applications by using the Mule Maven plugin. To do so, you must meet certain prerequisites, and configure your CloudHub deployment strategy in your project's `pom.xml` file.

If you want to deploy applications to CloudHub using a different method, see:

* xref:studio::deploy-mule-application-task.adoc[Deploy Applications to CloudHub Using Anypoint Studio]
* xref:anypoint-cli::cloudhub-apps.adoc#deploy-to-cloudhub[Deploy Applications to CloudHub Using the Anypoint CLI]
* xref:runtime-manager::deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploy Applications to CloudHub Using Runtime Manager]

== Prerequisites

Before you can deploy to CloudHub using the Mule Maven plugin, you must complete the following tasks:

* Add the Mule Maven plugin to your project
+
See xref:mmp-concept.adoc#add-mmp[Add the Mule Maven Plugin to a Mule Project] for instructions.
* If you are using the HTTP Listener as source for your flow, you need to set its host to *0.0.0.0* and its port to *${http.port}*
* Declare all external classes and resources in the `exportedPackages` and `exportedResources` fields on the `mule-artifact.json` file

== Configure the CloudHub Deployment Strategy

Configure the CloudHub deployment strategy in your project's `pom.xml` file so you can deploy, redeploy and undeploy your Mule application using the Mule Maven plugin.

Inside the `plugin` element in your project's `pom.xml` file, configure your CloudHub deployment, replacing the placeholder values with your CloudHub information:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::mule-runtime::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <cloudHubDeployment>
      <uri>https://anypoint.mulesoft.com</uri>
      <muleVersion>${app.runtime}</muleVersion>
      <username>${username}</username>
      <password>${password}</password>
      <applicationName>${cloudhub.application.name}</applicationName>
      <environment>${environment}</environment>
      <region>${region}</region>
      <workers>${workers}</workers>
      <workerType>${workerType}</workerType>
      <properties>
        <key>value</key>
      </properties>
    </cloudHubDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

== Deploy to CloudHub

From the command line in your project's folder, package the app and execute the deploy goal:
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn clean deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

== Redeploy to CloudHub

To redeploy a Mule application using Mule Maven plugin, run `mvn clean deploy -DmuleDeploy` as you did to previously deploy the app. CloudHub rewrites the app you had deployed.

== Undeploy from CloudHub

To undeploy a Mule application using Mule Maven plugin, run the following command:

[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn mule:undeploy
----

The undeploy command also deletes the app in Mule Maven plugin 3.3.0 and later versions.

== Authentication Methods

== CloudHub Deployment Reference

The following table shows the available parameters to configure the CloudHub deployment strategy in your project's `pom.xml` file.
