You might want to remove specific attributes from within an XML tag that are known to contain sensitive data. The DataWeave example defines a function in the DataWeave header that removes a specific XML attribute from the passed element and its children.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]


This example uses:

* `mapObject` to go through each element.
* `@` to refer to the attributes in an XML element.
* `if` and `else` to conditionally only list XML attributes when they are present, and also to only recursively call the function when a child element is an object.
* `is` to check if each child is of type `Object` .
* `-` to remove an element from the list of XML attributes.
* `inlineCloseOn="empty"` on the output directive, so that the output XML displays self-closing tags when there are no values.
