At design time, your Mule application must have at least these three basic components:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols=",,"]
|===
| Component | Type | Description
| `src`
| Folder
| The source directory for your application's productive source code and tests. +
See a reference for this folder below.

| `pom.xml`
| Descriptor
| The pom file of your Mule application. +
This file describes all of your application's required dependencies.


| `mule-artifact.json`
| Descriptor
| The mule-artifact file of your Mule application. +
This file describes how your Mule application is composed.

|===

These three components are mandatory. If one is missing, the packager tool won't package your project into a deployable JAR file. +
Additionally, the packager tool does not consider any other directory or file in the root folder of your Mule application.


== Source Directory Reference

The `src` directory has two main folders: "main" and "test". +
The packager tool does not consider any other directory inside `src` when packaging the application.

=== src/main

src/main is the root folder for all the productive source code of the application.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols=",,"]
|===
|Folder  | Folder Type | Description

p| `src/main/mule`
| source
| Root folder of the Mule configuration files. +
It can contain nested folders, in the way of Java packages.

This folder is mandatory.

| `src/main/resources`
| resource
| It contains the application resources, such as xml, json, and properties files. +
Jars file located here are loaded by the application classloader but as plain file resources.
|===

The packager tool sends all files inside src/main/mule and src/main/resources to the root directory of your binary package. +
Nested folders within src/main/mule are preserved as directories within the root directory of the binary package.

=== src/test

src/test is the root folder for all the test source code of the application.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols=",,"]
|===
|Folder | Folder Type | Description

| `src/test/java`
| source
| Itâ€™s the root folder of the test classes used to validate the custom Java code of the app. +
It follows the conventions of any normal Java application.

| `src/test/munit`
| source
| It contains the MUnit source code. +
It can contain nested folders in the way of packages.

| `src/test/resources`
| resource
| It contains resources, such as xml, json,  and properties files. +
This folder also contains files describing metadata being referenced in the mule-config.xml
