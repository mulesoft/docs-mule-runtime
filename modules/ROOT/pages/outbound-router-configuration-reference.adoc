== Pass through router

This router always matches and simply sends or dispatches message via the endpoint that is configured.

[%header,cols="10,10,10,10,60"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|enableCorrelation |enumeration |no |IF_NOT_SET |Specifies whether Mule should give outgoing messages a correlation ID. The default behavior is to give messages a correlation ID only if they don't already have one, so that existing correlation IDs are maintained.
