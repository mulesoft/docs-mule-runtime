This page provides details on the elements you configure for exception strategies. This information is pulled directly from `mule.xsd` and is cached.

Provides default exception handling.

.Attributes of <default-exception-strategy...>
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|enableNotifications |boolean |no |  |Determines whether ExceptionNotifications will be fired from this strategy when an exception occurs. Default is true.
|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Name of the exception strategy that will be used in ref attribute of 'exception-strategy' element
|when |string |no |  |The expression that will be evaluated to determine if this exception strategy should be executed. This should always be a boolean expression.

.Child Elements of <default-exception-strategy...>
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|commit-transaction |0..1 |These exceptions will be considered "delivered" after handling by the exception strategy. Any exception not accepted by this filter will be redelivered/rolled back. You can set a comma-separated list of wildcard patterns that will be matched against the fully qualified class name of the current exception.
|rollback-transaction |0..1 |These exceptions will be redelivered/rolled back after handling by the exception strategy. You can set a comma-separated list of wildcard patterns that will be matched against the fully qualified class name of the current exception.
|abstract-message-processor |0..1 |A message processor A placeholder for message processor elements.
|abstract-outbound-endpoint |0..1 |An outbound endpoint A placeholder for outbound endpoint elements. Outbound endpoints dispatch messages to the underlying transport.
|abstract-mixed-content-message-processor |0..1 |A placeholder for message processor elements.
|===

== Custom exception strategy

A user-defined exception strategy.

.Attributes of <custom-exception-strategy...>
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|enableNotifications |boolean |no |  |Determines whether ExceptionNotifications will be fired from this strategy when an exception occurs. Default is true.
|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Name of the exception strategy that will be used in ref attribute of 'exception-strategy' element
|when |string |no |  |The expression that will be evaluated to determine if this exception strategy should be executed. This should always be a boolean expression.
