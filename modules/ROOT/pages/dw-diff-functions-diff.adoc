[[diff1]]
== diff&#40;Any, Any, { unordered?: Boolean }, String&#41;: Diff

Returns the structural differences between two values.


Differences between objects can be ordered (the default) or unordered. Ordered
means that two objects do not differ if their key-value pairs are in the same
order. Differences are expressed as `Difference` type.

=== Parameters

[%header, cols="1,3"]
|===
| Name | Description
| `actual` | The actual value. Can be any data type.
| `expected` | The expected value to compare to the actual. Can be any data type.
| `diffConfig` | Setting for changing the default to unordered using `{ "unordered" : true} (explained in the introduction).
|===

=== Example

This example shows a variety of uses of `diff`.
