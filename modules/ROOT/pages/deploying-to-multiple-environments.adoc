You can configure your Mule application to automatically load property files based on the development environment (QA, preproduction, production, etc) you are working on, making it easier to deploy your app both on-premises and in the cloud. This configuration requires you to complete the following tasks:

. Create a properties file for each development environment in your application.

. Configure a properties placeholder in your app to look for the environment upon launch.

. Set an environment variable to point to a specific development environment during application deployment.


Consider externalizing other aspects of your configuration, like time-out values, polling frequencies, and so on, even if these configurations don't vary between environments. This configuration facilitates tuning and experimenting because the Mule application becomes fully configurable through a single properties file.

== Considerations when Using Environment Properties

Consider the following guidelines when you configure environment properties:

* Use a consistent naming strategy for your properties files and make them unique across applications.
+
This practice ensures that files are easy to reuse across teams. A good strategy is to add the application name or application ID to the properties file names.
* If you are deploying multiple applications through a xref:shared-resources.adoc[shared resources] structure, do not set anything in the properties files.
+
Doing so can cause conflicts between the various apps that share a domain. Instead, you can set environment variables that span the scope of the deployed app, its domain, and other apps under that domain.
+
In Studio, you can create environment variables using the *Environment* tab of the *Run Configurations* menu. You can access the Environment tab from the drop-down menu to the right of the *Play* button.

== Basic Architecture of an Environment Property Configuration

The following Mule configuration fragment defines a global property called `env`, a dynamic configuration properties file (based on the `env` property), and an HTTP connector with variable configuration:

[source,xml,linenums]
----

<global-property doc:name="Global Property" name="env" value="qa" />
<configuration-properties doc:name="Configuration properties" file="${env}.yaml" />
<http:listener-config name="HttpListenerConfiguration"
                      doc:name="HTTP Listener Configuration"
                      host="${host}"
                      port="${port}"
                      basePath="${path}" />
----

This example uses Spring's property placeholder resolution mechanism. The variable bits: the *base path*, *host*, and *port* are clearly visible and can vary for each environment where this connector gets deployed in.

When deploying your application, you can dynamically replace the `env` property with the particular environment to which you're deploying, such as `qa` or `prod`. This causes the Mule application to load a different `.yaml` file with properties specific to the configured environment.

To provide values for these environment variables, we use a Yaml configuration file for each environment:

.Properties File: qa.yaml
----
path: "test/products"
host: "localhost"
port: 8082
----

.Properties File: prod.yaml
----
path: "products"
host: "www.acme.com"
port: 8081
----


== Creating and Configuring Environment Properties

Create variable properties files and configure them in your application to look for the environment upon launch. Additionally, you can test environment properties in Studio. To complete these tasks review the following steps:

=== Using Studio Visual Editor

. Define a list of environments you wish to support in your application. For example, one common use case involves configuring the application to support both Production and a QA environments. +
We will define the variable `variable` in the environments `prod` and `qa` and test it using a single application.

[start=2]
. Right-click the `src/main/resources` folder, then select  *New*  >  *File*   to create a properties file for each environment you wish to support. For example:
** `qa.yaml`
** `prod.yaml`
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-01.png["A Package Explorer showing a project structure with folders for different environments including Production and QA in Anypoint Studio"]

. Double-click each of these new files to open them in new tabs in Studio. By editing them, you can configure the properties of the environment that correspond to the filename. For example, you may wish to add the properties as per the following images. Keep in mind that you can use these properties anywhere in your application.
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-02.png["A QA YAML configuration file"]
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-03.png["A Production YAML configuration file"]

. Close the properties files.

. Click in the Global Elements tab of your Studio project, below the canvas.

. *Create* a new global element.  When selecting the element type, pick *Configuration properties*  under *Global Configurations*.
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-04.png["Configuration panel for choosing a global element type including Configuration Properties under Global Configurations in Anypoint Studio"]

. Set the value of the *File* field to `+++${env}+++.yaml`
+
. *Create* a new property to add a default environment. When selecting the element type, pick *Global Property*  under *Global Configurations*.
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-05.png["Configuration panel for choosing a global element type including Global Property under Global Configurations in Anypoint Studio"]

. Set a value to the property.
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-06.png["A settings dialog with environment variable for QA in Anypoint Studio"]

. You can change the environment by editing the configured *Global Property* value.

=== Using XML Editor

. Define a list of environments you wish to support in your application. For example, one common use case involves configuring the application to support both Production and a QA environments. +
We will define the variable `variable` in the environments `prod` and `qa` and test it using a single application.

[start=2]
. Right-click the  `src/main/resources`  folder, then select  *New*  >  *File*   to create a properties file for each environment you wish to support. For example:
** `qa.yaml`
** `prod.yaml`
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-01.png["A Package Explorer showing a project structure with folders for different environments including Production and QA in Anypoint Studio"]

. Double-click each of these new files to open them in new tabs in Studio. By editing them, you can configure the properties of the environment that correspond to the filename. For example, you may wish to add the properties as per the following images. Keep in mind that you can use these properties anywhere in your application.
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-02.png["A QA YAML configuration file"]
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-03.png["A Production YAML configuration file"]

. Close the properties files.

. Click in the Configuration XML tab of your Studio application, below the canvas.

. Add a *configuration-properties* element to the XML file and let the file name configurable.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<configuration-properties doc:name="Configuration properties" file="${env}.yaml" />
----

[start=7]
. Add a *Global Property* element to set the default environment name.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<global-property doc:name="Global Property" name="env" value="qa" />
----
[start=8]
. You can change the environment by editing the configured *Global Property* value.


=== Testing Configured Environment Properties in Studio

You can test that your application uses the specific environment you configured in your variables properties file, by running the application in Mule embedded in Studio.

. In the Package Explorer view, right-click the filename of the project you wish to deploy, then select *Run As* > *Mule Application*.

. Studio automatically deploys your application according to the environment variable you specified in the *Global Property* from the previous procedure.

. Again in the Package Explorer view, right-click the filename of the project you wish to deploy, then select *Run As* > *Run Configurations...*.
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-07.png["A Package Explorer view showing how to run configurations in a project structure"]

. Define the System Property in the `Arguments` tab.
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-08.png["A Run Configurations panel"]

. Click the `Run` button to complete the procedure. The properties configured in `prod.yaml` will be used instead of the ones defined in `qa.yaml`.

== Setting Environment Variables for Application Deployment

Mule loads the environment variables when it starts, so depending on your deployment target (CloudHub or On-premises) you need to set the environment when you deploy the app (CloudHub) or when you start your Mule instance (On-premises).

=== Setting a Specific Environment when Starting Mule On-Premises

==== Using the command line

Identify the environment in which to deploy your application at runtime with an environment variable. Execute the command to run Mule in your environment as per the following example:

[source,console,linenums]
----
$ mule -M-Denv=prod
----

Once Mule starts with your configured environment, you can deploy the application with your desired deployment method.

==== Using Anypoint Runtime Manager

As a prerequisite you need to xref:runtime-manager::servers-create.adoc[create a server in Anypoint Runtime Manager] and link it to Mule. Then you can xref:runtime-manager::servers-properties-create.adoc[create a custom server property].


=== Setting a Specific Environment when Deploying to CloudHub

==== Deploying to CloudHub from Studio

From Studio you can initiate the process to set your properties environment variables and deploy your application to CloudHub :

. In the Package Explorer view, right-click the filename of the project you wish to deploy, then select *Anypoint Platform* -> *Deploy to Cloud*.
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-09.png["A Package Explorer view showing how to deploy applications to CloudHub"]

. Complete the requested data, and click the *Properties* tab.

. Add a new environment variable by setting *Key* to *env* and its value to *prod*.
+
image::deploying-to-multiple-environments-10.png["CloudHub deployment settings for an application with environment-specific properties"]

. Click *Deploy Application*.

==== Deploying to CloudHub from Runtime Manager

To deploy your application to CloudHub via Anypoint Runtime Manager, you can xref:configuring-properties#setting-properties-values-in-runtime-manager.adoc[set properties values] using Runtime Manager Console.
