= Deploying to Multiple Environments
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Throughout the different phases in the development lifecycle you may wish to deploy an application to multiple different environments, such as Production, QA and Test. You can configure your Mule application to facilitate deployment to one of many different environments, both on-premise and in the cloud. To do so, you must complete the following macro steps:

. In your application, create a properties file for each environment.

. Configure a property placeholder in your application to look for the deployment environment upon launch.

. Configure an environment variable to point to a  specific environment during application deployment.

Consider externalizing other aspects of your configuration, like time-out values, polling frequencies, etc... even if they don't vary between environments. This will facilitate tuning and experimenting as the whole Mule application would become configurable through a single properties file.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with the exercise of building and deploying Mule applications in Mule Studio. Consider reading the xref:3.7@mule-fundamentals.adoc[Mule Fundamentals] for more information.

== Configuring an Application to Deploy in Multiple Environments

[.ex]

[discrete.view]
=== STUDIO Visual Editor

. Define a list of environments you wish to support in your application. For example, one common use case involves configuring the application to support both Production and a QA environments.

. Right-click the  `src/main/resources`  folder, then select  *New*  >  *File*   to create a properties file for each environment you wish to support. For example:
* qa.properties
* production.properties
+
image::properties-files-alt.png[properties_files]

. Double-click each of these new files to open them in new tabs in Studio. By editing hem, you can configure the properties of the environment that correspond to the filename. For example, in `production.properties`, you may wish to add the properties as per the image below.  Keep in mind that you can use these properties anywhere in your application.

====

. Close the properties files.

. Click in the Global Elements tab of your Studio project, below the canvas.

. *Create* a new global element.  When selecting the element type, pick *Property Placeholder*  under *Component Configurations*.

. Set the value of the *Location* field to  `${mule.env}.properties`

. To configure Studio to use a specific environment when  *deploying on-premise* , *debugging*  or  *using xref:3.6@datasense.adoc[DataSense]*  to retrieve metadata from a SaaS provider, double-click to open your application's  `mule-project.xml` file, located in the root directory of your project.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you deploy your application to the cloud, in Studio select *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* -> *Cloud*. Studio allows you to specify your environment variables prior to deployment, effectively enabling you to choose your deployment environment at runtime.
====

. Add an environment variable named *`mule.env`* with a value that matches the environment to which you wish to deploy by default (in the image below, the value is `qa`).
+
image::runtime-env.png[runtime_env]

. Close the `mule-project.xml` file, then save your application. When you debug your application or deploy it on-premise, Studio deploys to the environment you specified in the `mule-project.xml` file.

. To change the default deployment environment at any time, change the value of the environment variable key. For example, to deploy to a test environment – assuming you have a `test.properties` file in your application– change the value to `test`.

<context:property-placeholder resources="$mule.env.properties"/>

== Deploying to a Specific Environment

Use the procedures below to deploy an application to a specific environment – production, qa, test, etc. – from Studio.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== On-Premise

[discrete]
==== Studio

. In the Package Explorer, right-click the filename of the project you wish to deploy, then select *Run As* > *Mule Application*.

. Studio automatically deploys your application according the environment variable you specified in the `mule-project.xml` file in the procedure above.

[discrete]
==== Standalone

Identify the the environment in which to deploy your application at runtime with an environment variable. Execute the command to run your mule application as per the example below.

[source,text,linenums]
----
/.bin/mule -M-Dmule.env=production
----

[source,console,linenums]
----
$ mule -M-Dmule.env=production
----

[discrete.view]
=== CloudHub

. In the Package Explorer, right-click the filename of the project you wish to deploy, then select *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* -> *Cloud*.

. Then enter your Anypoint Platform credentials and domain particulars

. Click the *plus* sign under "environment variables" to add a new environment variable. Set the *Key* of this new variable to *mule.env* and it's value to the environment you wish to deploy to (QA in this example).
+

. Click *Finish* to deploy.
