= Migrating the Secure Properties Placeholder

In Mule 3, the Secure Properties Placeholder was part of the Security Module. In Mule 4, it is separated in its own Secure Configuration Properties module.

.Example: Complete Secure Properties Placeholder in Mule 3
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<secure-property-placeholder:config
  name="Secure_Property_Placeholder" key="${prod.key}"
  location="test.${env}.properties" encryptionAlgorithm="Blowfish"
  encryptionMode="CBC"/>
----

Differences between Mule 3 and Mule 4:

* The Mule 3 `location` attribute is replaced by `file` in Mule 4 for consistency with other components.
* In Mule 3, `location` can define more than one file, separated by a comma (`,`). In Mule 4, this is not possible for troubleshooting purposes. Instead, you need to define a `<secure-properties:config>` tag for each file.
* For overlapping properties between files, Mule 3 preserves the last definition. The Mule 4 module preserves the first definition.

* The encryption attributes (`mode` and `algorithm`) are defined in the child tag `<secure-properties:encrypt/>`, and the supported algorithms and modes are the same for both Mule 3 and 4 (see xref:secure-configuration-properties.adoc[Mule 4 Secure Configuration Properties]).

A full migration of the Mule 3 example looks like this:

<secure-properties:config
  key="${prod.key}"
  file="test.${env}.properties"
  name="Secure_Property_Placeholder">
    <secure-properties:encrypt algorithm="Blowfish" mode="CBC"/>
</secure-properties:config>
