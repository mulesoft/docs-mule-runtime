The following Mule transports provide access to TCP connections:

* The TCP Transport, discussed on this page, which uses the basic TCP transport.
* The xref:ssl-and-tls-transports-reference.adoc[SSL and TLS Transports], which use TCP with socket-level security.

Other than the type of socket used, these transports all behave quite similarly.

The TCP transport allows sending or receiving messages over TCP connections. TCP is a layer over IP and used to implement many other reliable protocols such as HTTP and FTP. However, you may want to use the TCP transport directly if you require a specific protocol for reading the message payload that is not supported by one of these higher level protocols. This is often the case when communicating with legacy or native system applications that don't support web services.

== Considerations

TCP is one of the standard communication protocols used on the Internet, and supports communication both across the internet and within a local area network. The Mule TCP transport uses native Java socket support, adding no communication overhead to the classes in java.net, while allowing many of the advanced features of TCP programming to be specified in the Mule configuration rather than coded in Java.

Use this transport when communicating using low-level TCP connections. To determine when this is appropriate, you can use the following decision tree:

* Communicating with an external service that uses low-level unsecured TCP connections? If so, use the TCP protocol.

* Are you communicating with a flow always located in the same Mule application instance? If so, consider use the xref:vm-transport-reference.adoc[VM transport].

* Is it important that messages be persisted until they can be processed? If so, consider using a persistent transport like xref:jms-transport-reference.adoc[JMS] or xref:file-transport-reference.adoc[File].

* Are there advantages to a higher-level protocol built on top of TCP, for instance, the request-response features of xref:http-transport-reference.adoc[HTTP], or the store-and-forward features of xref:email-transport-reference.adoc[Email]? If so, use the transport for that protocol instead.

* Is performance the primary concern and it is not important that messages be delivered in the proper order or that the sender is notified if any are lost? If so, use the lighter-weight xref:udp-transport-reference.adoc[UDP transport] instead.

* Should messages be secured? If so, use the xref:ssl-and-tls-transports-reference.adoc[SSL transport].

* If you get this far, TCP is a good candidate.

As shown in the examples below, the TCP transport can be used to

* <<Creating a TCP Server>> a TCP server
* <<Sending Messages to a TCP Server>> messages to a TCP server
* <<Polling TCP Connector-Specific Attributes>> from a TCP server

== Features

The TCP module allows a Mule application both to send and receive messages over TCP connections, and to declaratively customize the following features of TCP (with the standard name for each feature, where applicable):

* The timeout for blocking socket operations. This can be declared separately for client and server operations. (SO_TIMEOUT)
* How long to keep the socket open to allow pending sends to complete. (SO_LINGER)
* Whether to send available data immediately rather than buffering it. (TCP_NODELAY)
* Whether to reuse a socket address immediately (SO_REUSEADDR)
* Whether to use keep-alive to detect when a remote system is no longer reachable (SO_KEEPALIVE).
* The size in bytes of the network buffer (SO_SNDBUF).
* The number of pending connection requests to allow.
* Whether to close a client socket after sending a message.

=== Protocol Tables

In addition, since TCP and SSL are stream-oriented and Mule is message-oriented, some application protocol is needed to to define where each message begins and ends within the stream. The table below lists the built-in protocols, describing:

* The XML tag used to specify them
* Any XML attributes
* How it defines a message when reading
* Any processing it does while writing a message

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|XML tag |Options |Read |Write |Notes
|<tcp:custom-class-loading-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly , maxMessageLength, classLoader-ref |Expects the message to begin with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Precedes the message with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Like the length protocol, but specifies a classloader used to deserialize objects
|<tcp:custom-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, class, ref |varies |varies |Allows user-written protocols, for instance, to match existing TCP services.
|<tcp:direct-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly |All currently available bytes |none |There are no explicit message boundaries.
|<tcp:eof-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly |All bytes sent until the socket is closed |none |
|<tcp:length-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly , maxMessageLength |Expects the message to begin with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Precedes the message with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |
|<tcp:safe-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly , maxMessageLength Expects the message to begin with the string "You are using SafeProtocol" followed by a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Expects the message to be preceded by the string "You are using SafeProtocol" followed by a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Precedes the message with the string "You are using SafeProtocol" followed by a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Somewhat safer than the length protocol because of the extra check. This is the default if no protocol is specified.
|<tcp:streaming-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead |All bytes sent until the socket is closed |none |
|<tcp:xml-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead |A message is an XML document that begins with an XML declaration |none |The XML declaration must occur in all messages
|<tcp:xml-eof-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead |A message is an XML document that begins with an XML declaration, or whatever remains at EOF |none |The XML declaration must occur in all messages
|===

=== Protocol Attributes

[%header,cols="4*"]
|===
|Name |Values |Default Value |Notes
|class |The name of the class that implements the custom protocol |  |See <<Extending This Transport>> for an example of writing a custom protocol
|classLoader-ref |A reference to a Spring bean that contains the custom classloader |  |
|maxMessageLength |the maximum message length allowed |0 (no maximum ) |A message longer than the maximum causes an exception to be thrown.
|payloadOnly |true |If true, only the Mule message payload is sent or received. If false, the entire Mule message is sent or received. |Protocols that don't support this attribute always process payloads
|ref |A reference to a Spring bean that implements the custom protocol |  |
|rethrowExceptionOnRead |Whether to rethrow exception that occur trying to read from the socket |false |Setting this to "false" avoids logging stack traces when the remote socket is closed unexpectedly
|===

== Usage

TCP endpoints can be used in one of three ways:

* To create a TCP server that accepts incoming connections, declare an inbound tcp endpoint with a tcp:connector. This creates a TCP server socket that will read requests from and optionally write responses to client sockets.
* To poll from a TCP server, declare an inbound tcp endpoint with a tcp:polling-connector. This creates a TCP client socket that will read requests from and optionally write responses to the server socket.
* To write to a TCP server, create an outbound endpoint with a tcp:connector. This creates a TCP client socket that will write requests to and optionally read responses from a server socket.

To use TCP endpoints, follow the following steps:

. Add the MULE TCP namespace to your configuration: +
* Define the tcp prefix using xmlns:tcp="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/tcp"
* Define the schema location with http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/tcp[http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/tcp +
]http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/tcp/3.3/mule-tcp.xsd
. Define one or more connectors for TCP endpoints.

=== Creating a TCP Server

To act as a server that listens for and accepts TCP connections from clients, create a simple TCP connector that inbound endpoints will use:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<tcp:connector name="tcpConnector"/>
----

=== Polling from a TCP Server

To act as a client that repeatedly opens connections to a TCP server and reads data from it, create a polling connector that inbound endpoints will use:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<tcp:polling-connector name="tcpConnector"/>
----

=== Sending Messages to a TCP Server

To send messages on a TCP connection, create a simple TCP connector that outbound endpoints will use:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<tcp:connector name="tcpConnector"/>
----

. Configure the features of each connector that was created. +
* Begin by choosing the protocol to be used for each message that will be sent or received.
* For each polling connector, choose how often it will poll and how long it will wait for the connection to complete.
* Consider the other connector options as well. For instance, if it is important to detect when the remote system becomes unreachable, set `keepAlive` to `true`.
. Create TCP endpoints. +
* Messages will be received on inbound endpoints.
* Messages will be sent to outbound endpoints.
* Both kinds of endpoints are identified by a host name and a port.

By default, TCP endpoints use the request-response exchange pattern, but they can be explicitly configured as one-way. The decision should be straightforward:

[%header,cols="4*"]
|===
|Message flow |Connector type |Endpoint type |Exchange Pattern
|Mule receives messages from clients but sends no response |tcp:connector |inbound |one-way
|Mule receives messages from clients and sends response |tcp:connector |inbound |request-response
|Mule reads messages from a server but sends no responses |tcp:polling-connector |inbound |request-response
|Mule reads messages from a server and sends responses |tcp:polling-connector |inbound |request-response
|Mule sends messages to a server but receives no response |tcp:connector |outbound |one-way
|Mule sends messages to a server and receives responses |tcp:connector |outbound |request-response
|===

== Example Configurations

*Standard TCP connector in flow*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<tcp:connector name="connector">
    <tcp:eof-protocol payloadOnly="false"/> ❹
</tcp:connector> ❶

<flow name="echo">
    <tcp:inbound-endpoint host="localhost" port="4444" > ❷
    <tcp:outbound-endpoint host="remote" port="5555" /> ❸
</flow>
----

This shows how to create a TCP server in Mule. The connector at ❶ defines that a server socket will be created that accepts connections from clients. Complete mule messages are read from the connection (direct protocol) will become the payload of a Mule message (since payload only is false). The endpoint at ❷ applies these definitions to create a server at port 4444 on the local host. The messages read from there are then sent to a remote tcp endpoint at ❸. +
The flow version uses the eof protocol (❹), so that every byte sent on the connection is part of the same Mule message.

*Polling TCP connector in flow*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<tcp:polling-connector name="pollingConnector"
             clientSoTimeout="3000" pollingFrequency="1000">
    <tcp:direct-protocol payloadOnly="true" />
</tcp:polling-connector> ❶

<flow name="echo">
    <tcp:inbound-endpoint host="localhost" port="4444" /> ❷
    <vm:outbound-endpoint path="out"  connector-ref="queue" /> ❸
</flow>
----

This shows how to create a TCP endpoint that repeatedly reads from an TCP server. The connector at ❶ defines that a connection will be attempted every second which will wait up to three seconds to complete. Everything read from the connection (direct protocol) will become the payload of a Mule message (payload only). The endpoint at ❷ applies these definitions to port 4444 on the local host. The messages read from there are then sent to a VM endpoint at ❸.

== Streaming protocol

TCP does not guarantee that data written to a socket is transmitted in a single packet, so if you want to transmit entire Mule messages reliably, you must specify an additional protocol. However, this is not an issue with streaming, so the streaming-protocol element is an alias for the "direct" (null) protocol.

== Xml protocol

TCP does not guarantee that data written to a socket is transmitted in a single packet, so if you want to transmit entire Mule messages reliably, you must specify an additional protocol. The xml-protocol element configures the XML protocol, which uses XML syntax to isolate messages from the stream of bytes received, so it will only work with well-formed XML.

== Eof protocol

TCP does not guarantee that data written to a socket is transmitted in a single packet, so if you want to transmit entire Mule messages reliably, you must specify an additional protocol. The eof-protocol element configures a protocol that simply accumulates all data until the socket closes and places it in a single message.

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|rethrowExceptionOnRead |boolean |no |  |Rethrow the exception if read fails

== Direct protocol

TCP does not guarantee that data written to a socket is transmitted in a single packet. Using the direct-protocol element to configure the "null" protocol does not change the normal TCP behavior, so message fragmentation may occur. For example, a single sent message may be received in several pieces, each as a separate received message. Typically, it is not a good choice for messaging within Mule, but it may be necessary to interface with external TCP-based protocols.

== Safe protocol

Similar to length-protocol, safe-protocol also includes a prefix. Verification of the prefix allows mis-matched protocols to be detected and avoids interpreting "random" data as a message length (which may give out-of-memory errors). This is the default protocol in Mule 2.x.

== Length protocol

The length-protocol element configures the length protocol, which precedes each message with the number of bytes sent so that an entire message can be constructed on the received.

== Extending This Transport

When using TCP to communicate with an external program, it may be necessary to write a custom Mule protocol. The first step is to get a complete description of how the external program delimits messages within the TCP stream. The next is to implement the protocol as a Java class.

* All protocols must implement the interface `org.mule.transport.tcp.TcpProtocol`, which contains three methods:
** `Object read(InputStream is)` reads a message from the TCP socket
** `write(OutputStream os, Object data)` writes a message to the TCP socket
** `ResponseOutputStream createResponse(Socket socket)` creates a stream to which a response can be written.

* Protocols which process byte-streams rather than serialized Mule messages can inherit much useful infrastructure by subclassing `org.mule.transport.tcp.protocols.AbstractByteProtocol`This class
** implements `createResponse`
** handles converting messages to byte arrays, allowing subclasses to implement only the simpler method `writeByteArray(OutputStream os, byte[] data)`
** provides methods `safeRead(InputStream is, byte[] buffer)` and `safeRead(InputStream is, byte[] buffer, int size)` that handle the situation where data is not currently available when doing non-blocking reads from the TCP socket

Suppose we want to communicate with a server that has a simple protocol: all messages are terminated by **>>>**. The protocol class would look like this:

== Notes

TCP and SSL are very low-level transports, so the usual tools for debugging their use, for instance, logging messages as they arrive, might not be sufficient. Once messages are being sent and received successfully, things are largely working. It may be necessary to use software (or hardware) than can track messages at the packet level, particularly when a custom protocol is being used. Alternatively, you can debug by temporarily using the direct protocol on all inbound endpoints, since it will accept (and you can then log) bytes as they are received.
