= Importing a Maven Project into Studio

If you have a Mule project that was built using http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] outside Anypoint Studio, you can still import it into Studio and continue to work on it with the benefits of the Studio IDE.

[WARNING]
*Important*: if you use the Maven *studio:studio* goal, you cannot use the *m2eclipse* plugin, because it will override the studio:studio goal. Anypoint Studio has built in capabilities for importing and exporting between Maven and Studio using the studio:studio goal, which covers most use cases.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you have xref:installing.adoc[downloaded and installed Anypoint Studio]. If you do not have any previous experience with Eclipse or an Eclipse-based IDE, please review the brief introduction to the xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio interface]. The document also assumes you're familiar with http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven].

== Importing a Maven Project into Studio

Studio has a built-in functionality to import a Maven project.

. In Studio, go to *File > Import...*
. Select **Mule > Maven-based Mule Project from pom.xml**, then click *Next*.

. Navigate to the location of the *pom.xml* file you wish to import. Mule will automatically populate a Project Name, but you can adjust it.

. Be sure to select the runtime you wish to use. Check *Copy project into workspace* if you want to create a copy of your project that resides in your workspace.
. Click *Finish*.

Anypoint Studio then internally runs the studio:studio goal and imports the Maven project into Studio, building the folder structure and files based on the instructions in the POM.

== Troubleshooting

=== M2_REPO Classpath Variable Errors

After you open your Maven project in Studio you might encounter error messages (as illustrated below). You may need to set the **M2_REPO** classpath variable or, if it has already been set, re-point it to the correct repository.

. In Studio, right-click your project's name in the *Package Explorer*, then select *Properties*.
. In the *Properties* pane, click *Java Build Path* in the menu on the left, then click the *Libraries* tab.

. Click **Add Variable...**.
. In the *New Variable Classpath Entry* panel, click the **Configure Variables...** button.

. Select the `M2_REPO` item from the list of classpath variables, then click **Edit...**.
+
[NOTE]
If `M2_REPO` does not appear as an item in the list of classpath variables, click *New...* to create this classpath variable.
+

. Change the contents of the *Path* field to specify the location of your Maven (`.m2`) repository.
+

. Click *OK* in each of the open panels to save your changes.
. Click the *Problems* tab in the console to confirm that the errors are no longer listed, which means they have been resolved.

=== Missing Required Repositories

You might also encounter the error below:

`Failed to execute goal on project schema-extractor-plugin: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.mule.tooling:schema-extractor-plugin:maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT...`

Mule is indicating that some dependencies or artifacts cannot be resolved. Ensure that the required plugin repositories are included in your pom file.
