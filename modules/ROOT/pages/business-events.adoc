Mule applications can collect business events information about flows and message processors that handle your business transactions. This information can include transaction execution time, errors, and results (successful completion or failure), and message payload information.

* Transactions (flow-level event groupings): Logical groupings of related events that often correspond to a business view of the system.

* Events (component-level events): Low-level details of a transaction. Events map to message processors and connectors. Events can also be exceptions and custom events. All events, except for custom events, are considered default events.

== Business Event Configurations

You can enable and create business events in a number of ways:

* Components such as the Choice router allow you to enable Business Events.
* Custom Business Event component: For setting up custom events to capture specific payload information. Also, some default events are automatically generated by Mule servers.

== Monitoring Business Events

You can enable Insight in the Runtime Manager to monitor these events at runtime. These events can help you analyze the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and test for compliance to company procedures.

Certain default events are tracked automatically once Insight is enabled, but others need to be enabled in your application before they are tracked.

Note that Batch processors does not support the use of Business Events.

== Configuring Business Events

There are two ways to configure business event tracking in Mule:

* Configure custom business events at specific points within a flow.
* Enable default event tracking for a flow or for specific message processors/connectors within a flow.

Custom event tracking is supported by the custom business event element. Custom events are always tracked once they're configured. Custom events allow you to track high-level activities in your flow that are relevant to your business.

Default event tracking is supported by all connectors and selected message processors. Enabling default events for these elements allows you to perform advanced debugging at runtime.
