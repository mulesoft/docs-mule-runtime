By default, *Poll Scopes* in Mule are set to poll a resource every 1000 milliseconds for new data. At times, you may wish to adjust the default polling interval, or configure the *polling schedule* to follow a more complex logic.

This document offers details on how to configure a polling schedule via two methods made available in Anypoint Studio:

. <<Fixed Frequency Scheduler>>
. <<Cron Scheduler>>

== Assumptions

This document assumes that your are familiar with xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)[polling] in general.  Read more about xref:poll-reference.adoc[poll scopes] in Mule.

== Fixed Frequency Scheduler

As the name implies, this method of configuring a poll schedule simply defines a fixed, time-based frequency for polling a source.

=== Studio Visual Editor

In Studio's visual editor, open the *Poll* message processor's *properties editor*. Select *Fixed frequency scheduler*, then adjust the values of the fields according to the table below.

[%header,cols="4*"]
|===
|Field |Default Value |Description |XML
|*Frequency* |1000 |Polling frequency, relative to time unit. When set to 0 or a negative value, it switches to the default. a|
----
frequency="1000"
----

|*Start Delay* |0 |Upon triggering the flow for the first time, Mule stalls the running of the poll for a specific amount of time. This time period is expressed in the same time units as the frequency. a|
----
startDelay="0"
----

|*Time unit* |MILLISECONDS a|
The time unit for the frequency value.

MILLISECONDS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS

 a|
----
-------
timeUnit="MILLISECONDS"
-------
----

|===

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor


In Studio's XML editor, add a *`fixed-frequency-scheduler`* child element to your *`poll`* element. Configure the child element's attributes according to the table below.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<poll doc:name="Poll">
        <fixed-frequency-scheduler frequency="1000" timeUnit="MILLISECONDS" startDelay="0"/>
        <sfdc:authorize config-ref="SalesforceGlobal" display="Salesforce1" doc:name="Salesforce1"/>
    </poll>
----

[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
|Attribute |Description |Example
|`frequency` |Polling frequency, relative to time unit. When set to 0 or a negative value, it switches to the default. a|
----
frequency="1000"
----

|`timeUnit` a|
The time unit for the frequency value.

MILLISECONDS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS

 a|
----
timeUnit="MILLISECONDS"
----

|`startDelay` |Upon triggering the flow for the first time, Mule stalls the running of the poll for a specific amount of time. This time period is expressed in the same time units as the frequency. |`startDelay="0"`

== Cron Scheduler

As the name implies, this method allows you to configure a polling schedule using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron] expressions. If you're not familiar with cron syntax, don't be intimidated! It's reasonably easy to learn, and you can even leverage online tools that can help you build cron expressions.

=== Studio Visual Editor

In Studio's visual editor, open the Poll message processor's *properties editor*. Select *Cron scheduler*, then adjust the value of the *Expression* field according to the table below.

image::cron-scheduler.png[cron_scheduler]

[%header,cols="4*"]
|===
|Field |Default Value |Description |XML
|*Expression* |  - |Use cron expression to define poll schedule. a|
----
expression="1 1 1 1,7 *"
----

The table below offers a few examples of typical Cron expressions:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Expression |Behavior
|0 0 12 * * ? |Poll at 12pm (noon) every day
|0 15 10 ? * * |Poll at 10:15am every day
|0 15 10 * * ? |Poll at 10:15am every day
|0 15 10 * * ? * |Poll at 10:15am every day
|0 15 10 * * ? 2005 |Poll at 10:15am every day during the year 2005
|0 * 14 * * ? |Poll every minute starting at 2pm and ending at 2:59pm, every day
|0 0/5 14 * * ? |Poll every 5 minutes starting at 2pm and ending at 2:55pm, every day
|1 1 1 1,7 * |Poll the first day of January and the first day of June, every year (in the first second of the first minute of the first hour) +

=== XML Editor

In Studio's XML editor, add a *`schedulers:cron-scheduler`* child element to your *`poll`* element. Configure the child element's attribute according to the table below.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<poll doc:name="Poll" frequency="1000">
        <schedulers:cron-scheduler expression="1 1 1 1,7 *"/>
        <sfdc:authorize config-ref="SalesforceGlobal" display="Salesforce1" doc:name="Salesforce1"/>
    </poll>

[%header,cols="4*"]

|Parameter |Default Value |Description |Example
|`expression` |- |Use cron expression to define poll schedule. a|
----
expression="1 1 1 1,7 *"

Here are a few examples of typical Cron expressions:

[%header,cols="2*"]

|Expression |Behavior
|0 0 12 * * ? |Poll at 12pm (noon) every day
|0 15 10 ? * * |Poll at 10:15am every day

|0 15 10 * * ? * |Poll at 10:15am every day
|0 15 10 * * ? 2005 |Poll at 10:15am every day during the year 2005
|0 * 14 * * ? |Poll every minute starting at 2pm and ending at 2:59pm, every day
|0 0/5 14 * * ? |Poll every 5 minutes starting at 2pm and ending at 2:55pm, every day
|1 1 1 1,7 * |Poll the first day of January and the first day of June, every year (in the first second of the first minute of the first hour)
