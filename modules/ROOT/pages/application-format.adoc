The deployment unit of a Mule application encapsulates everything an application needs to function, such as libraries, custom code, configuration, deployment descriptor and any environment properties accompanying the application. It exists in one of two formats:

* `.zip` file (a regular archive with a 'zip' extension in lower case)
* unpacked version of the same `.zip` file (exploded app)

Mule supports the deployment of both packaged (zipped) and exploded (unzipped) applications.

You can share libraries between applications via the xref:mule-application-deployment-descriptor.adoc[*application deployment descriptor*] attribute.
