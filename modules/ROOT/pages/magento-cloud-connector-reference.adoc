*Purpose:* The Magento Cloud Connector enables a Mule application to access the Magento Sales Order APIs.

*Minimum Configuration:* The configuration reference, Config reference, which is found under the General tab. You also must set up a Magento global element in Mule Studio.

*Discussion:* The configuration reference, Config reference, is set to a Magento global element that you have previously set up in Mule Studio. For the Magento global element, you need an address and authentication credentials (user name and password) for the application.

You must have created a Mule Studio global element for the Magento cloud connector. You can do so from the Global Element pane prior to dropping the Magento Cloud Connector on the canvas. Or, you can create the global element from within a Magento Pattern Properties dialog when setting the Config reference property.

Set the Config reference and Operation properties from the General tab in the Pattern Properties dialog:

* Select the Magento global element for the configuration reference from the Config reference pull-down list. If you have not yet created a Magento global element, click the Add button to do so. (See <<Magento Global Element>>.)
* Select a Magento operation from the Operation pull-down list. Operations correspond to the available Magento APIs.

After you select an operation, the bottom half of the screen displays the properties that can be set for the selected operation. (See the figure below.)

Properties marked with a red x are required. When possible, Mule Studio supplies default values for properties and you may change these values. For example, for the operation "Add order invoice comment", the dialog displays the following properties:

* Invoice id: This property is required.
* Comment: This property is required.
* Send email: Mule Studio sets this property to a default value of false.
* Include comment in email: Mule Studio sets this property to a default value of false.

== Magento Global Element

Click the Add button next to the Config reference field in the Pattern Properties dialog to create a Magento global element. (You can also do this from the Global Elements pane.) If you have selected a Magento global element from the Config reference pull-down list, you can click the Edit button to modify configuration values in that global element.

You enter the Magento application address and authentication information (username and password) in the global element properties.
