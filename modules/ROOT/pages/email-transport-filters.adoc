Filters can be set on an endpoint to filter out any unwanted messages. The Email transport provides a couple of filters that can either be used directly or extended to implement custom filtering rules.

|org.mule.providers.email.filters.AbstractMailFilter |A base filter implementation that must be extended by any other mail filter.
|org.mule.providers.email.filters.MailSubjectRegExFilter |Applies a regular expression to a Mail Message subject.

This is how you define the MailSubjectRegExFilter in your Mule configuration:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<message-property-filter pattern="to=barney@mule.org"/>
----

The 'pattern' attribute is a regular expression pattern. This is defined as java.util.regex.Pattern.
