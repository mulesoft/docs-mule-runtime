== Mule Core Changes

The following table shows Mule 3.x components and expressions and how to replace them in Mule 4.0. Some replacements may still be in development and are marked as such.

[%header,cols="30,70"]
|===
Mule 3.x Component|Mule 4.0 Replacement|
All router |Use scatter gather instead or execute the operations one after the other with different target attributes and then use DW to merge results.|
async[‘processingStrategy’]|Async processing strategies are no longer needed with the non-blocking execution engine. Use an “async” scope wrapping all the components if you want them to behave asynchronously.|
asynchronous-processing-strategy|Async processing strategies are no longer needed with the non-blocking execution engine. Use an “async” scope wrapping all the components if you want them to behave asynchronously.|
bridge|Removed. Use flows.|
catch-exception-strategy|Use error-handler with an on-error-continue strategy.|
choice-exception-strategy|Use error-handler with different strategies inside using error type selection or when attribute.|
combine-collections-transformer|No longer needed with the simplified message model. MuleMessageCollections are replaced with arrays of Mule Messages, which can be merged or iterated through using any Mule component, such as DataWeave or foreach.|
component|Use the Java module (in development).|
composite-source|Create one flow per each source and invoke a private flow using flow-ref for the common functionality|
configuration[‘defaultExceptionStrategy-ref’]|New name is defaultErrorHandler-ref|
configuration[‘flowEndingWithOneWayEndpointReturnsNull’]|No longer needed with new execution engine.|
configuration[‘useExtendedTransformations’]|Removed.|
configuration[enricherPropagatesSessionVariableChanges]|Removed.|

custom-router-resolver|Removed.|
custom-router|Removed.|
custom-service|Use flows|

expression-component|Use DataWeave, scripting component, the Mule SDK (in development), or the Java module (in development).|
file-queue-store|Use the new VM Connector (in development).|
flow[‘processingStrategy’]|Removed. Non blocking execution engine ensures that users do not need to tune this.|
idempotent-message-filter|Replacement in development.|
idempotent-redelivery-policy|New name is redelivery-policy.|
idempotent-secure-hash-message-filter|A function to apply a hash over the payload can be used as the id expression attribute value of the idempotent-redelivery-message.|
in-memory-store|Use object store module extension to create custom stores.|
inbound-endpoint|Use connectors.|
include-entry-point|Use the Java module (in development).|
interceptor-stack|Replacement in development.|
invoke|Use the Java module (in development).|

model|Removed. Use flows instead. |
mule[‘version’]
outbound-endpoint|Element moved from thecore namespaceto the newtransports namespace|
parse-template
poll -> watermark|Use of the object-store module to manually set the watermark values|
poll|replaced with scheduler source|
pooling-profile[‘disabled’]|New attribute|
