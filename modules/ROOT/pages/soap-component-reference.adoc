The *SOAP Component* facilitates the publishing, consuming, and proxying of *SOAP Web Services* within a Mule flow.

Mule leverages Apache's open-source http://cxf.apache.org/docs/a-simple-jax-ws-service.html[CXF framework] to build Web services. You can create a CXF Web service in Studio by configuring a SOAP component in your Mule flow to perform any of the following CXF Web service operations:

* publish a simple service
* publish a JAX-WS service
* proxy a published service
* consume a service using a simple client
* consume a service using JAX-WS client
* proxy to a service

Using Mule's SOAP Component, you can also xref:enabling-ws-security.adoc[enable WS-security], specify data bindings, and add interceptors to your CXF Web service. For more information about how Mule leverages the CXF framework, consult the xref:cxf-module-configuration-reference.adoc[CXF Module Configuration Reference].

[NOTE]
In 3.x versions of Mule Studio, you could specify an *onException* attribute for your SOAP Component. +
As of Mule 3.3 — because of the improvements to error handling which manage exceptions — you do not need to specify an *onException* attribute.
=====

== Applying Global CXF Configuration

To set up and reuse customized CXF behavior, you must create a *global element* and reference it within the SOAP component(s) in your Mule flows. The following configuration information applies to all types of Web service Operations (service, client and proxy).

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. On your canvas, click the *Global Elements* tab, then click the *Create* button, then select `CXF Configuration` from the list of available options.
+

[NOTE]
You can also create a *Global CXF Element* directly from the SOAP component's *Pattern Properties* panel. Next to the *Config Reference* field, click the image:add.png[(plus)] icon to open the *Global Element Properties* panel.
+
. Configure the global CXF configuration attributes according to the table below.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Value |Description
|*Name* |unique name |Enter a unique name for the global element, if you wish.
|*Configuration Location* |filepath/filename.xml |If you have created an `.xml` file that supplies the specifics of how you want your CXF elements to behave, enter the file path of your CXF configuration file.
|*Enable Mule Soap Headers* |true (_default_) +
false  |If set to true (i.e. checked) this attribute ensures that Mule can add a header to a SOAP message when required as part of the message's processing. +
For example, if your SOAP messages will be processed by a third-party schema which prohibits deviations from very specific message properties and will not process messages with Mule headers, set this attribute to false (i.e. uncheck).
|*Initialize Static Bus Instance* |true (_default_) +
false  |If set to true, (i.e. checked) this attribute ensures that the CXF Web service uses Mule transports instead of http://cxf.apache.org/docs/transports.html[CXF transports].
|===
. Click the *Message Flow* tab to return to your canvas.
. Open the Pattern Properties panel of the SOAP component, again.
. Use the drop down menu in the *Config Reference* field to select the global CXF element you created.
+
. Click *OK* to save your changes to the SOAP component.

[discrete.view]
=== Studio XML Editor or Standalone

. Above all flows in your Mule project, add a global cxf:configuration element. Refer to code sample below.

|===
|Attribute |Value |Description
|*name* |unique name |Enter a unique name for the global element, if you wish. (not required for Mule Standalone)
|*enableMuleSoapHeaders* |true +
false  |If set to true`,` this attribute ensures that Mule can add a header to a SOAP message when required as part of the message's processing. +
For example, if your SOAP messages will be processed by a third-party schema which prohibits deviations from very specific message properties and will not process messages with Mule headers, set this attribute to false.
|*initializeStaticBusInstance* |true +
false  |If set to true, (i.e. checked) this attribute ensures that the CXF Web service uses Mule transports instead of http://cxf.apache.org/docs/transports.html[CXF transports].

== Adding Custom Interceptors

CXF uses chains of http://cxf.apache.org/docs/interceptors.html[interceptors] – the most basic processing unit – to process messages. As a message moves through an interceptor chain, each interceptor performs an action upon the message, such as reading it, transforming it or validating it.

If you need to add an extra action to the messages processed by your CXF Web service (for instance, to add a header to a message), use the SOAP component to add extra interceptors to the interceptor chain.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Open the *Pattern Properties* panel, then click on the *Interceptors* tab.
. Click on the image:add.png[(plus)] icon to reveal the four **http://cxf.apache.org/docs/interceptors.html[Interceptor Providers]** CXF uses to add interceptors to interceptor chains; click one of the choices to add an interceptor provider. +

* `Add in Interceptor`
* `Add in Fault Interceptor`
* `Add out Interceptor`
* `Add out Fault Interceptor`
+
. Double-click the newly created interceptor provider in the *Settings* pane (below, left) to open the interceptor provider panel (below, right).
+
. Use the drop down menu in the *Beans* field to select from your list of existing beans the one that will act as an interceptor.
+

[NOTE]
If you have not yet created any beans, click the *new* button to open a new *Properties Panel* that facilitates the creation and configuration of new a bean, which imports the Java class you have built to specify the interceptor's behavior.

. Click the *add to list* button to insert the selected bean into the interceptor chain.
. Click *Finish*, then *OK* to save your interceptor configurations.

[discrete.view]
=== Studio XML Editor

. Above all flows in your Mule project, create a global spring:bean element to import the Java class you have built to specify the interceptor's behavior. Refer to code sample below.
. To the CXF element in your flow, add a child element according to the type of action you want the interceptor to perform:
* cxf:inInterceptor
* cxf:inFaultInterceptor
* cxf:outInterceptor
* cxf:outFaultInterceptor

. As a child element of the CXF interceptor element, add a reference to the spring bean, spring:ref *bean*, you created which imports the Java class.
. Add as many as four interceptor child elements to your CXF service or client component.

[source,xml,linenums]

       </cxf:inInterceptors>
    </cxf:proxy-service>
...
</flow>
----
=====

Adding Web Service Security

*_Enterprise_* +
To protect the CXF Web service in your Mule flow, you can configure elements in the SOAP component to apply WS-security. You can add http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-security.html[WS-Security] *Configuration Elements* (i.e. key-value pairs) to validate and/or authenticate information in the SOAP header of a message; you can also enable one or more of six *Token Validators* to ensure message security. The ability to add these security features is available only in the Enterprise Edition of Mule Studio.

Consult the xref:enabling-ws-security.adoc[Enabling WS-Security] document to configure the security elements of your Web service.

== Configuring Advanced Elements

You can adjust several advanced CXF Web service configurations according to your requirements.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Open the *Pattern Properties* panel, then click on the *Advanced* tab.
+
. Adjust configurations as needed according to the table below, then click *OK* to save your changes.

. Within the context of the CXF framework, http://cxf.apache.org/docs/data-binding-architecture.html[*data binding*] refers to the mapping of data from XML documents to Java objects. You can specify the databinding of your client or service, if you wish. (Not configurable on proxy service or proxy client.) The following are the different types of databinding available:
* http://cxf.apache.org/docs/aegis-21.html[aegis-databinding]
* http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jaxb.html[jaxb-databinding]
* custom-databinding
* http://jibx.sourceforge.net/[jibx-databinding] +

. To the CXF element in your flow, add a child element according to the type of databinding you want your service or client to use:
* cxf:aegis-databinding
* cxf:jaxb-databinding
* cxf:custom-databinding
* cxf:jibx-databinding

. As a child element of the CXF databinding element, add one or more `spring:property` elements with either a name and value, or name and reference, to define any databinding properties. Refer to the code sample below.
. Define a *`cxf:schemalocations`* attribute, if you wish, to identify a namespace to which your service should refer. (Not configurable on JAX-WS client, simple client or proxy client.) Reference http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms256100.aspx[schemaLocation] for additional details. To the CXF element in your flow (below any interceptor elements, if you have added any), add a **`cxf:schemaLocations`** child element.
. Within the `cxf:schemaLocations` element, add a `cxf:schemaLocation` child element, to specify the URL of the schema to which your service should refer. Refer to code sample below.
. As per your specific needs, configure any of the following CXF service or client attributes according to the table below. Refer to the code sample below.
