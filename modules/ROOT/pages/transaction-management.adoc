Mule applies the concept of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_processing[transactions] to operations in application for which the result cannot remain indeterminate.  In other words, where a series of steps in a flow must succeed or fail as one unit, Mule uses a transaction to demarcate such a unit.  For example, you might use a transaction to encapsulate several steps in a flow for which the end result involves committing information to a database.  In this type of scenario, the commit is either entirely complete and succeeds, or is incomplete and it fails. Even if partially complete, the commit – or transaction – fails. Where a transaction fails, Mule rolls back the operations within the transaction so that no one part results in partial completion.

You can demarcate a transaction by applying a transaction to a connector. If a Mule flow begins with a transactional resource (such as an inbound connector), Mule can start a new transaction and manage the entire flow as a transaction. If your flow includes a transactional outbound connector, Mule manages the outgoing operation as a transaction. With both a transactional inbound and outbound connector, Mule executes the outgoing operation as part of the transaction initiated by the inbound connector.

The following connectors support transactional demarcation:

* JMS
* JDBC
* VM

*Note*: As of Mule 3.5.0, the xref:database-connector.adoc[Database Connector] replaces the JDBC connector, and the JDBC connector is deprecated. Applications that use the JDBC transport continue to work with the 3.5.0 Enterprise Runtime, but the connector is no longer available in the Studio palette to add to applications.

A Mule flow may begin with a non-transactional inbound connector – such as HTTP or SFTP – but which requires the use of a transaction within the flow. For example, a Mule flow may accept information from an external Web service,  then transform the data, before charging a credit card, and saving invoice information to a database. In such a situation, you can demarcate a transaction by wrapping the credit card charge and database commit operations within a transaction to ensure either complete success or complete failure and rollback.

Transaction Types

Mule supports three different types of transactions: single resource, multiple resource, and extended architecture (XA). The following table describes characteristics of each type.

*Note*: JDBC is deprecated.

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Type |Characteristics |Number of Resources |Available Resources |Performance
|xref:single-resource-transactions.adoc[Single Resource Transactions] a|
* Receives or sends messages to only one resource.

* Relative to the others, performs better

|xref:multiple-resource-transactions.adoc[Multiple Resource Transactions] a|
* Receives or sends messages to more than one resource.
* Can handle partial commits and rollbacks.
* Uses 1.5 commit protocol as opposed to two-phase commit protocol.

 |>1 a|

|xref:xa-transactions.adoc[XA Transactions] a|
* Receives or sends messages to more than one resource.
* Involves using an http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol[two-phase commit algorithm].
* Connectors must be XA-enabled.

[NOTE]
====
*Multi-source vs. XA* +

While xref:xa-transactions.adoc[XA Transactions] offer similar functionality, xref:multiple-resource-transactions.adoc[Multiple Resource transactions] use less overhead.  XA transactions are more reliable. Both can include JDBC resources.

== Assumption

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule and/or the xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio interface]. Further, this document assumes you have some knowledge of transaction processing and are familiar with xref:anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors].

== Configuring Transactions

You can demarcate a transaction by either applying a transactional configuration to a connector, or by wrapping several elements in a transactional scope.

* *Apply a transaction to an inbound connector* when you want Mule to handle the complete flow as a transaction.
* *Apply a transaction to an outbound connector* when you want Mule to handle the outgoing operation as part of an existing transaction.
* *Apply a transaction as a wrapper* (known as a *scope* in Studio) when you want to apply a transaction to elements within a flow that _do not_ begin with a inbound connector configured as a transaction.

The following subsections outline the steps to apply transactions in your flow.

=== Applying a Transaction to a Connector

You can apply a transaction to any of the following inbound or outbound connectors:

* JMS
* VM
* JDBC (Deprecated)

|*Timeout* |- |JMS   VM JDBC |Insert an integer to represent the number of milliseconds (ms) that Mule allows to pass before it ends the transaction. *Important:* The timeout transaction is only taken into account in XA transactions.
|===

. If applying an XA transaction type to your connector, you have the option to check the *Interact With External* box. When checked, Mule acknowledges transactions that began externally. For example, if you set the transaction Action to BEGIN_OR_JOIN, and check *Interact With External*, Mule joins any transaction that is already in progress when it receives a message, regardless of whether the transaction began outside of Mule.
. If you applied an XA transaction to multiple connectors in your flow, access the global connectors each references, and configure the connectors to use **XA-enabled resources**.

=== Configuration Tips and Tricks

* Operations that occur inside a transaction execute *synchronously*. You cannot build an asynchronous flow inside a transaction.
* If you apply an XA transaction to multiple connectors in your flow, be sure to configure the connectors to use *XA-enabled resources*.
* If you apply an XA transaction to a JMS inbound connector in your flow, you have the option of specifying the polling frequency of the queue. Access xref:xa-transactions.adoc[XA Transactions] for configuration details.
* Mule can manage** non-transactional outbound connectors.** By default, an outbound connector from a non-transactional transport ignores an active transaction rather than rejecting it. In other words, the default transactional action for such connectors is no longer `NONE`. The example code below illustrates this behavior. Mule processes messages it receives from the VM queue synchronously and transactionally. The file transport in the code example is not transactional thus, writing to the file is not part of the transaction. However, if a message throws an exception while Mule is creating the file, Mule rolls back the transaction and reprocesses the message. This example is, in effect, a multiple resource transaction.
* The timeout transaction is only taken into account in XA transactions.

== Transaction Exception Strategies

To handle exceptions Mule throws while processing transactions, you have three options:

. Configure no exception strategies for the flow or transaction, thus employing Mule's default exception strategy.
. Configure an exception strategy for the flow in which a transaction exists. The flow's exception strategy handles all exceptions Mule throws while processing the transaction.
. Configure an exception strategy for the scope of an individual transaction. The transaction's exception strategy handles all exceptions Mule throws while processing the transaction. If you wish to manage a transactional exception differently from all other exceptions thrown, consider applying an exception strategy to your transaction.

Refer to the xref:error-handling.adoc[Error Handling] documentation to learn more about Mule's default exception strategy and how to apply exception strategies to flows. Follow the steps below to apply an exception strategy to an individual transaction.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Add a *Transactiona*l scope to your flow (refer to steps above), then add building blocks within the scope to build a transaction.
. Search for an exception strategy and drag and drop it into the exception strategy section at the bottom of the scope.
+
image::transactional3.png[]
+
. Configure the exception strategy as needed, keeping in mind Mule uses this exception strategy to handle any exceptions thrown while processing the transaction. Reference the xref:error-handling.adoc[Error Handling] documentation for exception strategy configuration details.

[discrete.view]
=== Studio or Standalone XML

. Within your `transactional` scope, add an `exception-strategy` child element _at the bottom_ of the scope.
