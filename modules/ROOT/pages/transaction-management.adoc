Transactions are operations in a Mule app for which the result cannot remain indeterminate. When a series of steps in a flow must succeed or fail as one unit, Mule uses a transaction to demarcate that a unit. For example, you might use a transaction to encapsulate several steps in a flow that result in committing information to a database. In this type of scenario, the commit (or transaction) is either entirely complete and succeeds, or is incomplete and fails. Even if partially complete, the commit fails. When a transaction fails, Mule rolls back the operations within the transaction so that no one part results in partial completion.

The Try scope provides a way to configure a transaction from its General tab. The XML for this configuration looks like this:

.XML Example: Transaction Configuration in the Try Scope

In this example, the Try scope demarcates a transaction that includes a database operation and a VM operation. Either both will be applied, or none will be applied if an error is raised within the Try scope.

It's also possible to start a transaction from a message source. In that case, the entire flow is a transaction. This is useful when working with messaging connectors to prevent the consumption of the message if a problem occurs when processing it so you can later retry (because of the rollback).

In Studio, operations in these connectors provide an Advanced tab for setting up transactions:

* JMS:
 ** Listener supports Local and XA transaction types. When set, the entire flow is treated as a transaction.
 ** Consume and Publish operations support transactions.
* VM:
 ** Listener supports Local and XA transaction types. When set, the entire flow is treated as a transaction.
 ** Consume and Publish operations support transactions.
* Database:
 ** All database operations support transactions.

Note that a Mule flow can begin with a non-transactional connector (such as HTTP) that requires a transaction within the flow. For example, a Mule flow might accept information from an external Web service, then transform the data before charging a credit card and saving invoice information to a database. In such a situation, you might use the Try scope to set up a transaction by wrapping the credit card charge and database commit operations within a transaction to ensure either complete success or complete failure and rollback.

== Transactional Actions

A Transactional Action (`transactionalAction`)

* ALWAYS_BEGIN: Always start a new transaction when receiving a message. An exception will be thrown if a transaction already exists. Listeners that support transactions have this option.

* ALWAYS_JOIN: Always expect a transaction to be in progress when a message is received. If there is no transaction, an exception is thrown. Operations that support transactions have this option.

* BEGIN_OR_JOIN: If a transaction is already in progress when a message is received, join the transaction if possible. Otherwise, start a new transaction. Scopes that support transactions provide this setting.

* JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE: Join the current transaction if one is available. Otherwise, no transaction is created. Operations that support transactions provide this setting.

* INDIFFERENT: Do not treat actions as a transaction. Scopes that support transactions provide this setting.

* NONE: Never participate in a transaction. Listeners that support transactions provide this setting.

* NOT_SUPPORTED: Execute outside any existent transaction. Operations that support transactions provide this setting. Scopes that support transactions provide this setting.

== Transaction Types

Mule supports Single Resource (Local, the default) and Extended Architecture (`XA`) transaction types (`transactionType`). The following table describes characteristics of each type.

* Single Resource Transactions (Local)
 ** Receives or sends messages to only one resource.
 ** Performs better than XA.

* XA Transactions
 ** Receives or sends messages to more than one resource.
 ** Involves using a two-phase commit algorithm.
 ** Connectors must be XA-enabled.
 ** Slower but more reliable than Local.
