The JXPath extractor transformer evaluates an XPath expression against the current message and returns the result. By default, a single result will be returned. If multiple values are expected, set the `singleResult` property to false, which will return a list of values. This property is available for strings only (not XML nodes).

You configure the JXPath extractor transformer as follows:

[source,text,linenums]
----

<jxpath-extractor-transformer name="invoice" expression="/book/title" singleResult="false"/>
