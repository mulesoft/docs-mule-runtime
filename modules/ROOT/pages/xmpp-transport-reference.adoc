The XMPP transport receives and sends Mule messages over the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which is also known as Jabber.

== Filters

There are several filters in the

https://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/3.6.0/apidocs/org/mule/transport/xmpp/filters/package-summary.html[org.mule.transport.xmpp.filters]

package that filter XMPP messages. `AbstractXmppFilter` is an abstract filter adapter that allows http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/index.jsp[Smack] filters to be configured as Mule filters.

The following filter classes extend the abstract filter:

* `XmppAndFilter`
* `XmppFromContainsFilter`
* `XmppMessageTypeFilter`
* `XmppNotFilter`
* `XmppOrFilter`
* `XmppPacketIDFilter`
* `XmppPacketTypeFilter`
* `XmppThreadFilter`
* `XmppToContainsFilter`

== Features

* Send and receive messages to/from an individual Jabber user
* Send and receive messages to/from a Jabber one-on-one chat
* Send and receive messages to/from a Jabber multi-user chat

== Usage

The configuration of a connector is mandatory as it identifies the Jabber server to connect to. Thus, all information to establish the connection such as the host to contact and the user credentials to use are configured here.

Configuration options on an endpoint include the type (whether it's a chat, a message or a groupchat) and the Jabber ID the endpoint is talking to.

The XMPP transport does not support transactions as the XMPP protocol is not transactional.

== Schema

Complete http://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/current3/schemadocs/namespaces/http_www_mulesoft_org_schema_mule_xmpp/namespace-overview.html[schema reference documentation].

== Maven

This transport is part of the following maven module:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mule.transports</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-transport-xmpp</artifactId>
  <version>3.6.0</version>
</dependency>
----

== Best Practices

Put your login credentials in a properties file, not hard-coded in the configuration. This also allows you to use different settings between development, test and production systems.

== Notes

The current implementation of the transport is limited to one-way endpoints only. The logic that supports request-response endpoints is currently not implemented.
