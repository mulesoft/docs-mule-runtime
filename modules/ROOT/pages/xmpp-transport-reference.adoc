The XMPP transport receives and sends Mule messages over the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which is also known as Jabber.

*Docs* - Links to the JavaDoc and SchemaDoc for the transport +
*Inbound* - Whether the transport can receive inbound events and can be used for an inbound endpoint +
*Outbound* - Whether the transport can produce outbound events and be used with an outbound endpoint +
*Request* - Whether this endpoint can be queried directly with a request call (via MuleClient or the EventContext) +
*Transactions* - Whether transactions are supported by the transport. Transports that support transactions can be configured in either local or distributed two-phase commit (XA) transaction. +
*Streaming* - Whether this transport can process messages that come in on an input stream. This allows for very efficient processing of large data. For more information, see Streaming. +
*Retry* - Whether this transport supports retry policies. Note that all transports can be configured with Retry policies, but only the ones marked here are officially supported by MuleSoft +

== Filters

There are several filters in the

https://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/current/apidocs/org/mule/transport/xmpp/filters/package-summary.html[org.mule.transport.xmpp.filters]

package that filter XMPP messages. `AbstractXmppFilter` is an abstract filter adapter that allows http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/index.jsp[Smack] filters to be configured as Mule filters.

The following filter classes extend the abstract filter:

* `XmppAndFilter`
* `XmppFromContainsFilter`
* `XmppMessageTypeFilter`
* `XmppNotFilter`
* `XmppOrFilter`
* `XmppPacketIDFilter`
* `XmppPacketTypeFilter`
* `XmppThreadFilter`
* `XmppToContainsFilter`

== Features

* Send and receive messages to/from an individual Jabber user
* Send and receive messages to/from a Jabber one-on-one chat
* Send and receive messages to/from a Jabber multi-user chat

== Usage

The configuration of a connector is mandatory as it identifies the Jabber server to connect to. Thus, all information to establish the connection such as the host to contact and the user credentials to use are configured here.

Configuration options on an endpoint include the type (whether it's a chat, a message or a groupchat) and the Jabber ID the endpoint is talking to.

The XMPP transport does not support transactions as the XMPP protocol is not transactional.

== Example Configurations

*Receive Messages in a Flow*

*Simple Jabber Chat Client*

*Note*: In this code example, `spring-beans-current.xsd` is a placeholder. To locate the correct version, see http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/.

=== Transformers

These are transformers specific to this transport. Note that these are added automatically to the Mule registry at start up. When doing automatic transformations these will be included when searching for the correct transformers.

== Maven

This transport is part of the following maven module:

== Best Practices

Put your login credentials in a properties file, not hard-coded in the configuration. This also allows you to use different settings between development, test and production systems.

== Notes

The current implementation of the transport is limited to one-way endpoints only. The logic that supports request-response endpoints is currently not implemented.
