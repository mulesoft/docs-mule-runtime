:keywords: request reply, asynchronous

The Request-Reply Scope enables you to embed a pocket of asynchronous processing within a Mule flow. This functionality enables you to receive a response from an asynchronous flow without hardcoding the destination of the response. +
For example, you can use request-reply to convert a one-way VM or JMS connector flow to a request-response flow without having to change it's configuration. In other words, the request-reply converts part of a synchronous process into an asynchronous one.

== Basic Anatomy

Request-reply consists of two parts:

* The *request* section. +
It wraps an outbound connector that submits an asynchronous request to another flow or an external resource.
* The *reply* section. +
It wraps an inbound connector that receives an asynchronous response from another flow or an external resource

When the message reaches the processor inside the request section of the Request-Reply scope, Mule sends an asynchronous request to the outbound endpoint's path, triggering the process of the remote resource. +
Only after that processing is complete, Mule sends the response back to the path defined in the processor's inbound endpoint in the reply section of the scope.

Consider a very simple application:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="sampleFlow">

  <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/"/>

  <request-reply doc:name="Request-Reply">
   <vm:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="request"/> //<1>
   <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="reply" /> //<3>
  </request-reply>

</flow>

<flow name="requestFlow">
  <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="request"/> //<2>
  <logger message="#[payload]" level="INFO"/>
</flow>
----
<1> After receiving an HTTP request, the VM outbound-endpoint processor sends the message to the /request path.
<1> The VM inbound-endpoint processor with the /request path configured receives the message triggering the requestFlow processing.
<1> Only after requestFlow finish processing, Mule automatically sends the message back to VM inbound-endpoint in the reply section of the Request-Reply scope.

This is possible because Mule implicitly sets a MULE_REPLYTO message property to point to the processor in the reply section of the scope. +
In this case, the VM inbound-endpoint processor in requestFlow's source receives the message with the MULE_REPLYTO_REQUESTOR property set to "reply", so Mule sends the resulting message (or messages) back to the requester. +
This is important to note because if the requested flow would have another VM outbound endpoint at the end pointing to a different flow, the VM processor inside the reply scope would still receive the message (or messages) from the triggered flow. +
You can choose to disable this behavior by setting a MULE_REPLYTO variable:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="sampleFlow">
  <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/"/>
  <request-reply doc:name="Request-Reply">
   <vm:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="request"/>
   <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="reply" />
  </request-reply>
</flow>

<flow name="requestFlow">
  <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern="one-way" path="request"/>
  <set-variable variableName="MULE_REPLYTO_STOP" value="true"/> //<1>
  <logger message="#[payload]" level="INFO"/>
</flow>
----

<1> Setting MULE_REPLYTO_STOP to true, tell Mule to not configure the  MULE_REPLYTO_REQUESTOR property in the received message.


[IMPORTANT]
You can't use transactions in VM and JMS connectors inside a request-reply scope.

Transactions are not compatible with how the request-reply scope works. +
The request-reply scope does not send a request until a transaction is committed, and a transaction in turn is not committed until the entire flow executes, including the execution of the request-reply scope. This leads to a situation where both processes block each other. +
The runtime can't fully execute the flow because it's still waiting for the reply on the request-reply scope, but this reply never arrives because the request is not sent until the transaction is committed.
