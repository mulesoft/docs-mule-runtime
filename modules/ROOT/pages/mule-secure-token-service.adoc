The following Mule OAuth 2.0 solutions includes using the Mule Secure Token Service:

* Authentication for a CloudHub API
+
The Mule Secure Token Service can provide a solution for APIs and apps hosted by CloudHub.
+
* Client App authentication required by a server
+
The OAuth 2.0 solution is provided by a connector, such as the HTTP or Salesforce connector
+
* Authentication to protect an API from Clients
+
The OAuth 2.0 solution is provided by an API Manager policy.


== Client Authentication for a CloudHub API

The *Mule OAuth 2.0 Secure Token Service* functionality on *CloudHub* is limited due to the known xref:runtime-manager::managing-application-data-with-object-stores.adoc#semantics-and-storage-limits[Object Store limitations].

If those limitations don't affect your development, you can use the *Mule OAuth 2.0 Secure Token Service* on Cloudhub. Otherwise, create your own Object Store and configure the OAuth2 module to use your custom Object Store instead of the default.

Use Mule Secure Token Service to apply Oauth 2.0 to your Web service provider to:

* grant consumers of your Web service limited access to secure data
* avoid disclosing an end user's access credentials to a Web service consumer
* retain the authority to revoke the consumer’s access to an end user's secure data at any time

== Client Authentication Required by a Server

Configure authentication in your client Mule app when sending requests to a service that requires authentication, such as the Github OAuth2 server described in xref:authentication-in-http-requests.adoc#oauth2-authorization-code[OAuth2 - Authorization Code].

== Authentication to Protect an API from Clients

When you want to protect your API or app from receiving requests from unauthorized access, use an API Manager policy, such as the OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider policy. To expose a Web service protected by OAuth 2.0 security, see xref:api-manager::building-an-external-oauth-2.0-provider-application.adoc[API Manager documentation].
