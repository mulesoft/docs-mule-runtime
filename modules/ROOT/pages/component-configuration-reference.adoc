This page provides details on the elements you configure for components. This information is pulled directly from `mule.xsd` and is cached. For more information on components, see xref:configuring-components.adoc[Configuring Components].

== Component

A simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) component that's invoked by Mule when a message is received. The class or object instance to be used can be specified using a child object factory element, or via the 'class' attribute. If the 'class' attribute is used, an object factory cannot be configured as well. Using the 'class' attribute is equivilant to using the propotype object factory ('prototype-object' child element).

=== Attributes of component

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|`class` |Specifies a component class. This is a shortcut that is equivalent to providing a 'prototype-object' element. +
*Type*: `class name` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|===

=== Child Elements of component

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|`abstract-interceptor` |0..1 |A placeholder for an interceptor element.
|`interceptor-stack` |0..1 |A reference to a stack of interceptors defined globally.
|`abstract-object-factory` |0..1 |Object factory used to obtain the object instance that is used for the component implementation. The object factory is responsible for object creation and may implement different patterns, such as singleton or prototype, or look up an instance from other object containers.
|`abstract-lifecycle-adapter-factory` |0..1 |
|`binding` |0..* |A binding associates a Mule endpoint with an injected Java interface. This is like using Spring to inject a bean, but instead of calling a method on the bean, a message is sent to an endpoint.
|`abstract-entry-point-resolver-set` |0..1 |A placeholder for entry point resolver set elements. These combine a group of entry point resolvers, trying them in turn until one succeeds.
|`abstract-entry-point-resolver `|0..1 |A placeholder for an entry point resolver element. Entry point resolvers define how payloads are delivered to Java code by choosing the method to call.
|===

== Pooled component

A pooled POJO (Plain Old Java Object) component to invoke by Mule when a message is received. The instance can be specified via a factory or a class.

=== Attributes of pooled-component

[%header%autowidth.spread]

|Name |Description

== Pooling Profile

=== Attributes of pooling-profile

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Name |Description
|`maxActive` |Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted.

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`maxIdle` |Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time.

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`initialisationPolicy` |Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. +
Possible values are:

* `INITIALISE_NONE` - Does not load components into the pool on startup
* `INITIALISE_ONE` - Loads one initial component into the pool on startup
* `INITIALISE_ALL` - Loads all components in the pool on startup

*Type*: `enumeration` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `INITIALISE_ONE`
|`exhaustedAction` |Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. +
Possible values are:

* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL` - Throws a NoSuchElementException
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT` - Blocks by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW` - Creates a new Mule instance and return it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it blocks for at most that many milliseconds, after which a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown. If `maxThreadWait` is a negative value, it blocks indefinitely.

*Type*: `enumeration` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW`
|`maxWait` |Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`.

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`evictionCheckIntervalMillis` |Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed.

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`minEvictionMillis` |Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects are evicted from the pool due to idle time alone.

*Type*: `string` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
