This page provides details on the elements you configure for components. This information is pulled directly from `mule.xsd` and is cached. For more information on components, see xref:3.7@configuring-components.adoc[Configuring Components].

== Component

A simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) component that will be invoked by Mule when a message is received. The class or object instance to be used can be specified using a child object factory element, or via the 'class' attribute. If the 'class' attribute is used, an object factory cannot be configured as well. Using the 'class' attribute is equivalent to using the prototype object factory ('prototype-object' child element).

=== Attributes of <component...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|class |class name |no |  |Specifies a component class. This is a shortcut that is equivalent to providing a 'prototype-object' element.
|===

=== Child Elements of <component...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|abstract-interceptor |0..1 |A placeholder for an interceptor element.
|interceptor-stack |0..1 |A reference to a stack of intereceptors defined globally.
|abstract-object-factory |0..1 |Object factory used to obtain the object instance that will be used for the component implementation. The object factory is responsible for object creation and may implement different patterns, such as singleton or prototype, or look up an instance from other object containers.
|abstract-lifecycle-adapter-factory |0..1 |
|binding |0..* |A binding associates a Mule endpoint with an injected Java interface. This is like using Spring to inject a bean, but instead of calling a method on the bean, a message is sent to an endpoint.
|abstract-entry-point-resolver-set |0..1 |A placeholder for entry point resolver set elements. These combine a group of entry point resolvers, trying them in turn until one succeeds.
|abstract-entry-point-resolver |0..1 |A placeholder for an entry point resolver element. Entry point resolvers define how payloads are delivered to Java code by choosing the method to call.
|===

== Pooled component

A pooled POJO (Plain Old Java Object) component that will be invoked by Mule when a message is received. The instance can be specified via a factory or a class.

=== Attributes of <pooled-component...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|class |class name |no |  |Specifies a component class. This is a shortcut that is equivalent to providing a 'prototype-object' element.

|abstract-object-factory |0..1 |Object factory used to obtain the object instance that will be used for the component implementation. The object factory is responsible for object creation and may implement different patterns, such as singleton or prototype, or look up an instance from other object containers.
|abstract-lifecycle-adapter-factory |0..1 |

|abstract-entry-point-resolver |0..1 |A placeholder for an entry point resolver element. Entry point resolvers define how payloads are delivered to Java code by choosing the method to call.
|abstract-pooling-profile |0..1 |Characteristics of the object pool.
|===

== Pooling profile

=== Attributes of <pooling-profile...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|maxActive |string |no |  |Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted.
|maxIdle |string |no |  |Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time.
|initialisationPolicy |enumeration |no |INITIALISE_ONE |Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. The possible values are: INITIALISE_NONE (will not load any components into the pool on startup), INITIALISE_ONE (will load one initial component into the pool on startup), or INITIALISE_ALL (will load all components in the pool on startup)
|exhaustedAction |enumeration |no |WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW |Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL", which will throw a NoSuchElementException, "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT", which will block by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available, or WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which will create a new Mule instance and return it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it will block for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException will be thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it will block indefinitely.
|maxWait |string |no |  |Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT.
|evictionCheckIntervalMillis |string |no |  |Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed..
|minEvictionMillis |string |no |  |Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone.

|Name |Cardinality |Description
|property |0..* |Sets a Mule property. This is a name/value pair that can be set on components, services, etc., and which provide a generic way of configuring the system. Typically, you shouldn't need to use a generic property like this, since almost all functionality is exposed via dedicated elements.

A binding associates a Mule endpoint with an injected Java interface. This is like using Spring to inject a bean, but instead of calling a method on the bean, a message is sent to an endpoint.
