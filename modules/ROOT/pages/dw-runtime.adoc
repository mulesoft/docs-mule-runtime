This module contains functions that allow you to interact with the DataWeave
engine.


The functions described here are packaged in the Runtime module. The module
is included with Mule runtime, but you must import it to your DataWeave code,
for example, by adding the line `import dw::Runtime` or
`import * from dw::Runtime` to your header.
