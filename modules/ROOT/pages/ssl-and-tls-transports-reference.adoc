:keywords: anypoint studio, ssl, tls, transports

[WARNING]
This page refers to using SSL and TLS together with the old endpoint based
xref:http-connector.adoc[HTTP connector]. For using TLS with the new HTTP Connector and the
xref:web-service-consumer.adoc[Web Service Consumer] connector, see
xref:tls-configuration.adoc[TLS].

The following Mule transports provide access to TCP connections:

* The xref:tcp-transport-reference.adoc[TCP Transport], which uses the basic TCP transport.
* The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) transports use TCP with socket-level security.

Other than the type of socket used, these transports all behave quite similarly.

[NOTE]
xref:https://hosting.review/web-hosting-glossary/#12[SSL/TLS] are alternative names for the same transport. For simplicity, this page refers to the transport as only SSL, but everything here also applies to TLS.

The SSL transport allows sending or receiving messages over SSL connections. SSL is a layer over IP and implements many other reliable protocols such as HTTPS and SMTPS. However, you may want to use the SSL transport directly if you require a specific protocol for reading the message payload that is not supported by one of these higher level protocols. This is often the case when communicating with legacy or native system applications that don't support web services.

== Considerations

SSL is one of the standard communication protocols used on the Internet, and supports secure communication both across the internet and within a local area network. The Mule SSL transport uses native Java socket support, adding no communication overhead to the classes in java.net, while allowing many of the advanced features of SSL programming to be specified in the Mule configuration rather than coded in Java.

Use this transport when communicating using low-level SSL connections. To determine when this is appropriate, you can use the following decision tree:

* Communicating with an external service that uses low-level unsecured TCP connections? If so, use the xref:tcp-transport-reference.adoc[TCP] protocol.

* Are you communicating with a flow always located in the same Mule application instance? If so, consider using the xref:vm-transport-reference.adoc[VM transport].

* Is it important that messages be persisted until they can be processed? If so, consider using a persistent transport like xref:jms-transport-reference.adoc[JMS] or xref:file-transport-reference.adoc[File].

* Are there advantages to a higher-level protocol built on top of TCP, for instance, the request-response features of xref:deprecated-http-transport-reference.adoc[HTTP], or the store-and-forward features of xref:email-transport-reference.adoc[Email]? If so, use the transport for that protocol instead.

* Is performance the primary concern and it is not important that messages be delivered in the proper order or that the sender is notified if any are lost? If so, use the lighter-weight xref:udp-transport-reference.adoc[UDP transport] instead.

* Should messages be secured? If so, use the SSL transport.

As shown in the examples below, the SSL transport can be used to

* <<Create an SSL Server>> an SSL server
* <<Send Messages to an SSL Server>> messages to an SSL server

The use of SSL with Java is described in detail in the http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html[JSSE Reference Guide]. In particular, it describes the keystores used by SSL, how the certificates they contain are used, and how to create and maintain them.

== Features

The SSL module allows a Mule application both to send and receive messages over SSL connections, and to declaratively customize the following features of SSL (with the standard name for each feature, where applicable):

* The timeout for blocking socket operations. This can be declared separately for client and server operations. (SO_TIMEOUT)
* How long to keep the socket open to allow pending sends to complete. (SO_LINGER)
* Whether to send available data immediately rather than buffering it. (TCP_NODELAY)
* Whether to reuse a socket address immediately (SO_REUSEADDR)
* Whether to use keep-alive to detect when a remote system is no longer reachable (SO_KEEPALIVE).
* The size in bytes of the network buffer (SO_SNDBUF).
* The number of pending connection requests to allow.
* Whether to close a client socket after sending a message.



== Protocol Tables

In addition, since TCP and SSL are stream-oriented and Mule is message-oriented, some application protocol is needed to to define where each message begins and ends within the stream. The table below lists the built-in protocols, describing:

* The XML tag used to specify them
* Any XML attributes
* How it defines a message when reading
* Any processing it does while writing a message

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|XML tag |Options |Read |Write |Notes
|<tcp:custom-class-loading-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly , maxMessageLength, classLoader-ref |Expects the message to begin with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Precedes the message with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Like the length protocol, but specifies a classloader used to deserialize objects
|<tcp:custom-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, class, ref |varies |varies |Allows user-written protocols, for instance, to match existing TCP services.
|<tcp:direct-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly |All currently available bytes |none |There are no explicit message boundaries.
|<tcp:eof-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly |All bytes sent until the socket is closed |none |
|<tcp:length-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly , maxMessageLength |Expects the message to begin with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Precedes the message with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |
|<tcp:safe-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly , maxMessageLength Expects the message to begin with the string "You are using SafeProtocol" followed by a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Expects the message to be preceded by the string "You are using SafeProtocol" followed by a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Precedes the message with the string "You are using SafeProtocol" followed by a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Somewhat safer than the length protocol because of the extra check. This is the default if no protocol is specified.
|<tcp:streaming-protocol |rethrowExceptionOnRead |All bytes sent until the socket is closed |none |
|<tcp:xml-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead |A message is an XML document that begins with an XML declaration |none |The XML declaration must occur in all messages
|<tcp:xml-eof-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead |A message is an XML document that begins with an XML declaration, or whatever remains at EOF |none |The XML declaration must occur in all messages

== Usage

SSL endpoints can be used in one of two ways:

* To create an SSL server that accepts incoming connections, declare an inbound ssl endpoint with an ssl:connector. This creates an SSL server socket that reads requests from and optionally writes responses to client sockets.
* To write to an SSL server, create an outbound endpoint with an ssl:connector. This creates an SSL client socket that writes requests to and optionally reads responses from a server socket.

To use SSL endpoints, follow the following steps:

. Add the MULE SSL namespace to your configuration:
+
* Define the SSL prefix using `xmlns:ssl="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ssl"`
* Define the schema location with link:http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ssl[http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ssl +
] http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ssl/3.8/mule-ssl.xsd
. Define one or more connectors for SSL endpoints.

=== Create an SSL Server

To act as a server that listens for and accepts SSL connections from clients, create an SSL connector that inbound endpoints use:

[source,xml]
----
<ssl:connector name="sslConnector"/>
----

=== Send Messages to an SSL Server

To send messages on an SSL connection, create a simple TCP connector that outbound endpoints use:

[source,xml]
----
<tcp:connector name="sslConnector"/>
----

. Configure the features of each connector that was created.
* Begin by choosing the protocol to be used for each message that is sent or received.
* For each polling connector, choose how often it polls and how long it waits for the connection to complete.
* Consider the other connector options as well. For instance, if it is important to detect when the remote system becomes unreachable, set `keepAlive` to `true`.
. Create SSL endpoints.
* Messages are received on inbound endpoints.
* Messages are sent to outbound endpoints.
* Both kinds of endpoints are identified by a host name and a port.

By default, SSL endpoints use the request-response exchange pattern, but they can be explicitly configured as one-way. The decision should be straightforward:

[%header,cols="4*"]
|===
|Message Flow |Connector type |Endpoint type |Exchange Pattern
|Mule receives messages from clients but sends no response |ssl:connector |inbound |one-way
|Mule receives messages from clients and sends response |ssl:connector |inbound |request-response
|Mule sends messages to a server but receives no response |ssl:connector |outbound |one-way
|Mule sends messages to a server and receives responses |ssl:connector |outbound |request-response
|===



== Example Configurations

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
^|*SSL Connector in a Flow*

a|[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ssl:connector name="serverConnector" payloadOnly="false">
    <tcp:eof-protocol /> ❹
    <ssl:client path="clientKeystore"/>
    <ssl:key-store path="serverKeystore"/>
</tcp:connector> ❶


<flow name="echo">
    <ssl:inbound-endpoint host="localhost" port="4444" > ❷
    <ssl:outbound-endpoint host="remote" port="5555" /> ❸
</flow>
----
|===

This shows how to create an SSL server in Mule. The connector at ❶ defines that a server socket is created that accepts connections from clients. Complete mule messages are read from the connection (direct protocol) becomes the payload of a Mule message (since payload only is false). The endpoint at ❷ applies these definitions to create a server at port 4444 on the local host. The messages read from there are then sent to a remote ssl endpoint at ❸. +
 The flow version uses the EOF protocol (❹), so that every byte sent on the connection is part of the same Mule message. Note that both connectors specify separate keystores to be used by the client (outbound) and server (inbound) endpoints.

== Extending This Transport

When using TCP to communicate with an external program, it may be necessary to write a custom Mule protocol. The first step is to get a complete description of how the external program delimits messages within the TCP stream. The next is to implement the protocol as a Java class.

* All protocols must implement the interface `org.mule.transport.tcp.TcpProtocol`, which contains three methods:
** `Object read(InputStream is)` reads a message from the TCP socket
** `write(OutputStream os, Object data)` writes a message to the TCP socket
** `ResponseOutputStream createResponse(Socket socket)` creates a stream to which a response can be written.

* Protocols which process byte-streams rather than serialized Mule messages can inherit much useful infrastructure by subclassing `org.mule.transport.tcp.protocols.AbstractByteProtocol`This class
** implements `createResponse`
** handles converting messages to byte arrays, allowing subclasses to implement only the simpler method `writeByteArray(OutputStream os, byte[] data)`
** provides methods `safeRead(InputStream is, byte[] buffer)` and `safeRead(InputStream is, byte[] buffer, int size)` that handle the situation where data is not currently available when doing non-blocking reads from the TCP socket

Suppose we want to communicate with a server that has a simple protocol: all messages are terminated by **>>>**. The protocol class would look like this:

[source,java,linenums]
----
package org.mule.transport.tcp.integration;

import org.mule.transport.tcp.protocols.AbstractByteProtocol;

import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class CustomByteProtocol extends AbstractByteProtocol
{

    /**
     * Create a CustomByteProtocol object.
     */
    public CustomByteProtocol()
    {
        super(false); // This protocol does not support streaming.
    }

    /**
     * Write the message's bytes to the socket,
     * then terminate each message with '>>>'.
     */
    @Override
    protected void writeByteArray(OutputStream os, byte[] data) throws IOException
    {
        super.writeByteArray(os, data);
        os.write('>');
        os.write('>');
        os.write('>');
    }

    /**
     * Read bytes until we see '>>>', which ends the message
     */
    public Object read(InputStream is) throws IOException
    {
        ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        int count = 0;
        byte read[] = new byte[1];

        while (true)
        {
            // If no bytes are currently available, safeRead()
            //  waits until bytes arrive
            if (safeRead(is, read) < 0)
            {
                // We've reached EOF.  Return null, so that our
                // caller knows there are no
                // remaining messages
                return null;
            }
            byte b = read[0];
            if (b == '>')
            {
                count++;
                if (count == 3)
                {
                    return baos.toByteArray();
                }
            }
            else
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
                {
                    baos.write('>');
                }
                count = 0;
                baos.write(b);
            }
        }
    }
}

== Notes

TCP and SSL are very low-level transports, so the usual tools for debugging their use, for instance, logging messages as they arrive, might not be sufficient. Once messages are being sent and received successfully, things are largely working. It may be necessary to use software (or hardware) than can track messages at the packet level, particularly when a custom protocol is being used. Alternatively, you can debug by temporarily using the direct protocol on all inbound endpoints, since it accepts (and you can then log) bytes as they are received.
