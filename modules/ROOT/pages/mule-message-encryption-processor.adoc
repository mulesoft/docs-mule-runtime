== Encrypting a Message Payload

Add a *Mule Message Encryption Processor* to a flow to change the content of a message so that it becomes unreadable by other entities. Mule can encrypt the entire payload of a message or specific parts of the payload, according to security requirements, using one of the following three Encryption Strategies:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Encryption Strategy |Characteristics
|JCE Encrypter |• encrypts stream, byte[] or string
|XML Encrypter |• encrypts string +
• encrypts individual fields using xpath expressions
|PGP Encrypter |• encrypts stream, byte[] or string +
• applies tighter security (relative to JCE and XML) +
• increases processing load (relative to JCE and XML)
|===

=== JCE Encrypter

As Mule’s default encryption strategy, the Java Cryptology Extension (JCE) encrypter encodes a message payload, or part of a payload, according to the configurations of the following attributes:

* a plain key
* a key password
* a keystore
* a keystore password
* an algorithm (19 available, refer to <<Appendix>>)
* an encryption mode

To encrypt the payload of a message you must, at minimum, set the operation, encrypter, and the key, as well as create a basic Encryption global element. The key is the parameter to the encryption algorithm that determines the functional output of encryption or decryption. Without it, the encryption/decryption algorithm would not produce usable output.

To ensure functionality, Mule automatically applies the following default values to the message encryption configuration:

* Default input reference (the part of the payload which Mule encrypts): the whole message payload
* Default algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard[AES]
* Default encryption mode: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation[CBC]

However, you can configure any of the other attributes — all of which are optional — to define Mule’s encryption settings.

Configure the Encryption building block in the visual editor by opening the Properties window, shown below.

. Set the *Operation* field to `Encrypt`.
. Select `JCE_ENCRYPTER` from the *Select encrypter* drop-down menu.
. Select the *Define attributes* radio button.
. Enter a key in the *Key* field.

+

Or, configure the Encryption building block in the XML editor, as shown below:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<encryption:config >
   <encryption:jce-encrypter key="6Ijcb6LCb2*&h4<"/>
</encryption:config>
----

Next, create an Encryption global element by clicking the image:add.png[(plus)] icon next to the *Config Reference* field. In the Global Element Properties window:

image::globalencryption1.png[GlobalEncryption1]

. Enter a *Name* for the global element.
. In the *Default Encrypter* field, select `JCE_ENCRYTPER`.
. At this point, you can click *OK* to save this simple global Encrytper element, with no further configurations. If you do, Mule uses the configurations you defined in your local Encrypter message processor. However, if you wish to use a keystore, click the *Jce Encrypter* tab. +
. Select one of two radio buttons to configure the attributes of the Global element:
.. select the *Reference or expression* radio button to use an expression to reference attributes you have defined elsewhere in the XML configuration of your applications, or to reference the configurations defined in a bean.
.. select *Define attributes* to manually assign values to the attributes. Note that you can define all the attributes – except for *Keystore Path* and *Keystore Password* – in the local Encryption message processor, if you prefer.

=== XML Encrypter

The XML encrypter encodes XML string content in a message payload according to the configurations of the following attributes:

* key
* key password
* xpath (use to specify a particular part of a payload to encrypt)
* algorithm (four available: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard[AES]-128, AES-192, AES-256, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES[Triple DES])

To encrypt the payload of a message you must, at minimum,  set the operation, encrypter, and the key, as well as create a basic Encryption global element. Configure these in the visual editor (as described above for the JCE encrypter) or via XML code (shown below). By default, Mule automatically applies the AES-256 algorithm and encrypts the entire message payload.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<encryption:config >
   <encryption:xml-encrypter key="pNVDBAtJ8S8mXfHc"/>
</encryption:config>
----

However, you can configure any of the other three attributes — all of which are optional — to define Mule’s encryption settings.

=== PGP Encrypter

Mule has the ability to encrypt a message payload, or part of a payload, using http://www.pgpi.org/doc[Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)].  Because of its increased complexity, the topic has earned its own page: refer to the xref:pgp-encrypter.adoc[PGP Encrypter] document.

== Encrypting Part of a Message Payload

For details on message encryption in Mule, refer to the *Encrypt a Message Payload* section above.

By default, when you apply an encrypter, Mule encrypts the entire message payload. However, you can use a Mule Expression to encrypt a specific part of a message rather than the whole payload. Configure the *Input Reference* to define the specific part(s) of the payload you wish to encrypt.

image::engcryptionpayloadtostring3.png[EngcryptionPayloadtoString3]

Additionally, you can add an Xpath expression attribute to the XML encrypter to define specific field(s) to encrypt — credit card number or SSN, for example (see below). +
 +
 image:xpath-xml.png[xpath_XML]

[source,text,linenums]
----
 <encryption:encrypt  doc:name="Encrypt CC" using="XML_ENCRYPTER" config-ref="plainXML" input-ref="#[payload.toString()]">
            <encryption:xml-encrypter xpath="/users/cc"/>
        </encryption:encrypt>
----

== Decrypting a Message Payload

Add a *Mule Message Encryption Processor* to decrypt the content of a message so that it becomes readable by the message processors in your Mule application. Mule can decrypt the entire payload of a message or specific parts of the payload using one of the following three Encryption Strategies:

. JCE Decrypter
. PGP Decrypter
. XML Decrypter

Refer to *Encrypt a Message Payload* document for details on the Encryption strategies.

The type of encryption strategy you use to decrypt a message depends entirely upon the type of encryption employed by the message sender.

Further, you must configure a decrypter’s attributes to address the type of encryption the message’s sender applied. For example, if the message uses a keystore for encryption, your decrypter must use the keystore to decrypt the message.

== Decrypting Part of a Message Payload

Refer to the *Decrypting a Message Payload* section for details on message decryption in Mule.

By default, Mule decrypts the entire message payload when you apply a decrypter. However, you can use a Mule Expression to decrypt a specific part of a message payload rather than the whole payload. Configure the Input Expression to define the specific part(s) of the payload you wish to decrypt.

Additionally, you can add an Xpath expression attribute to the XML decrypter to define specific field(s) to decrypt — credit card number or SSN, for example (refer to the encryption screenshot and code in *Encrypt Part of a Message Payload*).
