*_Enterprise Edition_*

A *JDBC Transport* in Mule ESB facilitates a client’s access to a JDBC-compatible database, such as an Oracle database or Sybase database. In other words, when an end user (client) needs to access and use information in a database (stored on a server), Mule’s JDBC transport sits in the middle to connect them together and control the flow of information into, and out of, the database.

A JDBC transport can do more than just manage access to a database; it can also use stored procedures, *SQL queries*, to populate a database with information, for example, or manipulate the data it retrieved from a database. This Mule ESB example application demonstrates some of the things you can do with a JDBC transport and SQL queries.

In the *JDBC Example* application, an end user submits requests, via a Web browser, to a Mule application to access a database to perform four different tasks:

* transform, then save, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[Comma-Separated Value (CSV)] data to a database, then retrieve and return the data as a response to the end user
* clone records in the database, then return a response that indicates the number of records
* clear the database of its contents
* retrieve data from the database, then return the data as a response to the end user

The JDBC Example application cleverly performs several tasks:

. it uses JDBC endpoints and SQL queries together to manipulate data
. it sets properties on messages
. it parses and transforms message payload data
. it handles errors with a customized exception strategy

This example should enable you to create applications which input, retrieve and use data from a JDBC database. To understand more about Mule ESB’s ability to integrate services and systems, access the Mule xref:mule-examples.adoc[Mule Examples] and see other applications in action.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule ESB and the xref:mule-studio-essentials.adoc[Mule Studio interface]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more xref:mule-studio.adoc[Mule Studio Tutorials].

This document describes the details of the example within the context of *Mule Studio*, Mule ESB’s graphical user interface (GUI). Where appropriate, the XML configuration follows the Studio interface screenshot in an expandable section.

== Set Up

As with this JDBC Example, you can create template applications straight out of the box in *Mule Studio* or *Mule Standalone* (Mule ESB without Studio). You can tweak the configurations of these use case-based templates to create your own customized applications in Mule.

[WARNING]
====
*Database Required*

In order to interact with a functional example, you must have access to a **JDBC-compatible database**, such as Oracle or Sybase. You will need to complete the following three tasks before running the Mule JDBC example application (detailed procedure below):

. run two scripts on your database to create a table and store procedures
. configure the `db.properties` file in the Mule example so that the application can connect to your database
. add your database’s driver to the reference library in Mule

If you do not have access to a database to be able to see the application in action, you can still build the example application in *Mule Studio* or *Mule Standalone* and read this document, referencing the client-side user interface screenshots, to learn <<How it Works>>.

== How it Works

The *JDBC* example application consists of four flows, each of which processes a certain type of client request. The following offers a brief description of what each flow does in the application.

* The *CSVLoader* flow transforms CSV data, saves it to the database, then returns a response that displays the records in the database in XML format.
* The *DoubleMules* flow clones all the records in the database (i.e. doubles the database content), then returns a response that displays the number of records in the database.
* The *CleanupDB* flow wipes clear the contents of the database.
* The *AllMules* flow retrieves the information in all the records in the database, then returns a response that displays the records in XML format.

The sections below elaborate further on the flow-by-flow configurations of the JDBC example application and how it works to respond to end user requests.

[NOTE]
====
*Does order matter?*

It does not matter which flow appears first in this application; the *AllMules* flow can just as easily precede the *CSVLoader* flow, for example, without changing the functionality of the application.
====

[TIP]
====
*For Mule Studio Users*

In Mule Studio, double-click an icon representing a xref:studio-building-blocks.adoc[building block] to open its *Properties Panel* and examine the configuration details. Alternatively, you can click the *Configuration XML* tab to access and examine the application's XML config file.

image::config-tab.png[config_tab]
====

=== CSVLoader Flow

The *CSVLoader* flow saves http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[Comma-Separated Value (CSV)] data to the database, then returns a response that displays the records in XML format.

image::csvloader.png[CSVLoader]

// View the XML

==== Request

On the client-side user interface on a browser (see image below), the user clicks the *Load CSV Data* button to submit a request to the server-side application. The request asks Mule to save CSV data to the database, then return the data in XML format. (For this example, the developer pre-populated the *CSV Data to Load* field with data to enable you to easily use a functional example.)

image::launch-page3.png[launch_page3]

==== Ajax Inbound Endpoint

The request meets the JDBC example application and activates the CSVLoader flow. In this flow, the **xref:ajax-endpoint-reference.adoc[AJAX inbound endpoint] **“listens” for user requests on the `/services/jdbc/loadCSV` channel; that is to say, it waits for users to press the *Load CSV Data*. Note that this endpoint listens _only_ for user requests to load CSV data, not for requests to retrieve, clean up or clone database records: one type of request, one flow to process it. Further, because it has a one-way message exchange pattern, this Ajax endpoint only receives requests from the end user; it does not return responses.

In addition to listening for, and receiving, a message, the Ajax endpoint also transforms the data format of the message from CSV data to Java http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array[map objects]. To perform this transformation, the endpoint references a *Global CSV to Maps Transformer* to follow specific instructions on how to transform the data format. The image below, left, displays the Ajax endpoint's properties panel in Studio; note the section outlined in red in which the endpoint references the global CSV to maps transformer. The image below, right, displays the global CSV to maps transformer's properties panel in Studio.

// View the XML

[NOTE]
====
*What is a Global Element?*

Mule ESB supports *Global Elements* within application, such as the *JDBC Connector* and the *CSV2Maps Transformer* in the JDBC example.

Rather than repeatedly write the same code to apply the same configuration to multiple message processors, you can create one global element that details your configurations or transport details. Then, you can instruct any number of message processors in your Mule application to reference that global element.

*Learn more...*

In this example, the code that describes the configuration of the JDBC connector does not exist within the CSVLoader flow; rather the code resides in a global element which sits above all other flows in the application’s XML config file (and in the *Global Elements* tab in *Mule Studio*).

The Ajax endpoint references the global CSV2Maps transformer to obtain instructions on how to transform the data it receives; the JDBC endpoint references the global JDBC connector to obtain transport configuration details. The Ajax endpoint also references the global *Ajax Connector* automatically, so you do not need to specify the connector reference manually.
====


==== JDBC Endpoint

After receiving and converting the message payload with the Ajax endpoint, the flow uses a request-response **xref:database-jdbc-endpoint-reference.adoc[JDBC Endpoint]** to save CSV data to the database. In this case, the CSV data contains information about Mules that live on end user’s ranches, such as the Mule’s name, color and weight.

The JDBC endpoint in this flow performs two tasks:

. it accesses the database
. it saves data to the database with map objects

To perform these tasks, the JDBC endpoint works in conjunction with two other things: a *Global JDBC Connector* and a *SQL Query*, or stored procedure.

The xref:jdbc-transport-reference.adoc[JDBC connector] — a global element in the JDBC example application — helps the JDBC Endpoint with its tasks (listed above).

. As a xref:connecting-using-transports.adoc[connector], it helps the JDBC endpoint access the database by providing specific details about how to connect to it, such as where it exists (the URL), and how to gain access to it (username and password for database). See image below, left.
. It stores the SQL queries (i.e. stored procedures), one of which the JDBC endpoint in this flow references in order to save data to the database: `commitLoadedMules` (below, right).
+
image::global-jdbc.png[global_JDBC]

// View the XML

The JDBC endpoint in the CSVLoader flow simply references the connector information (see image below, left) and the SQL query (below, right) in the global JDBC connector. Note that you can store SQL queries on an individual JDBC endpoint in a flow and it will perform the procedures exactly the same as though referencing a global JDBC connector. The only reason to use a global JDBC connector to store your queries is to save time — if you anticipate using a query more than once in your application, you can efficiently write it once, in a global connector, then refer to it multiple times.

image::global-references.png[global_references]

// View the XML

==== Transformers

Because the end user expects a response in XML format, the CSVLoader flow uses a **xref:studio-transformers.adoc[Maps to XML Transformer] **to convert the message payload’s data format. Recall that the end user sent a request in CSV data format, and the Ajax endpoint transformed the content to map objects so the JDBC endpoint could save the data to the database. Mule now converts the message a second time in order to comply with the demand for an XML response.

The next building block in the flow, the **xref:property-transformer-reference.adoc[Property Transformer]**, sets a property on the message payload to specify the type of content it contains (for HTTP protocol). In this case, the `Set Property` property transformer sets the value of the property to `text/xml`.

==== Ajax Outbound Endpoint

Finally, the Ajax outbound endpoint returns a response to the end user. It directs its response — now a message payload which contains the CSV data in XML format — to the specific channel on which the client expects a response, `/jdbc/reply`.

==== Response

After Mule processes the end user request, it returns a response to the end user as a message in the *Response* field in the client-side user interface on her browser. The CSVLoader flow returns a message that appears as an XML list of all the Mules in the database (see image below).
+
image::csv-loaded4.png[csv_loaded4]

==== Rollback Exception Strategy

Notice that the CSVLoader flow also contains a **xref:rollback-exception-strategy.adoc[Rollback Exception Strategy]**.

If an error occurs in this flow, the rollback exception strategy catches the exception and performs two actions:

. it notifies the application administrator(s)
. it uses an Ajax endpoint to send a reply to the end user on the `/jdbc/reply` channel.

When rollback exception strategy handles an error, it ultimately returns a response to the end user's browser.

=== DoubleMules Flow

The *DoubleMules* flow clones records in the database, then returns a response to the end user to indicate the number of existing records. +
 +
 image:double-mules.png[double_mules]

 View the XML

==== Request

On the client-side user interface on a browser, the user clicks the *Clone Mules* button to submit a request to the server-side application.

==== Processing

In this flow, the Ajax endpoint “listens” for user requests on the `services/jdbc/clone` channel.

Next, the request-response JDBC endpoint calls the `callCloneStoredProc` procedure. Like the JDBC endpoint in the CSVLoader flow, the endpoint itself does not contain an SQL query, it simply references a stored procedure — `callCloneStoredProc` — on the global JDBC connector. According to the procedure, Mule clones the contents of the database, then passes the new count of total records to the next message processor as a Java object.

The *Object to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON[JSON] Transformer* converts the data format of the message payload so that the content — a count of all the Mules in the database — becomes http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-readable[human-readable].

Lastly, the Ajax outbound endpoint returns a response to the end user. It directs its response to the specific channel on which the client expects a response, `/jdbc/reply`.

==== Response

After Mule processes the end user request, it returns a response to the end user as a message in the *Response* field in the client-side user interface on his browser. The CSVLoader flow returns a message that appears as a simple record count (see image below). +


image::cloned-mules4.png[cloned_mules4]

=== CleanupDB Flow

The simplest flow in the application, the *CleanupDB* flow simply clears the database of its content.

image::clean-up.png[clean_up]

// View the XML

==== Request

On the client-side user interface on a browser, the user clicks the *Cleanup Mules* button to submit a request to the server-side application.

==== Processing

With only two building blocks, Mule begins processing a message with an Ajax endpoint which listens for end user requests. In this flow, the Ajax endpoint “listens” to the `services/jdbc/cleanup` channel.

The JDBC endpoint then follows the directives in the global JDBC connector’s `callCleanupStoredProc` SQL Query to remove all records from the database; it does not remove the table, only the data the table contains.

This is the only flow that does not return a response to the end user. The end user interface only displays a message to the user to confirm that it (the client) has sent a command to the database to clear its contents (see image below). +
 +
 image:table-wiped4.png[table_wiped4]

=== AllMules Flow

The *AllMules* flow simply retrieves data from the database and returns the data, in XML format, to the end user.

image::all-mules.png[all_mules]

// View the XML

==== Request

On the client-side user interface, an end user clicks the *Retrieve Mules* button to submit a request to the server-side application.

==== Processing

Listening for requests on channel `/services/jdbc/allMules`, the Ajax endpoint receives the request and passes it to the JDBC endpoint to retrieve data.

According to the instructions of the `selectLoadedMules` SQL query in the global JDBC connector, the JDBC endpoint retrieves all the data from the database and passes the map objects to the Maps to XML transformer.

From this point, the AllMules flow behavior mimics that of the CSVLoader flow:

* the `Maps to XML` transformer converts the message payload’s data format
* the `Set Property` transformer sets the content type, `text/xml` on the message payload
* the outbound `Ajax` endpoint returns a response to the user on channel `/jdbc/reply`

==== Response

After processing the end user request, Mule returns a response to the end user as a message in the *Response* field in the client-side user interface on her browser. The message contains an XML list of all the Mules in the database (see image below). +
 +
