As an Eclipse-based IDE, Anypoint Studio has adopted many of the functionalities Eclipse has to offer. However, you don't need to download a new IDE in order to take advantages of all that Studio provides. If you are already an Eclipse user, you can simply download and install **Studio as an Eclipse plug-in**.

[NOTE]
====
The *Anypoint Studio Eclipse plugin* is accessible in the Java, Java EE, and STS distributions that use **Eclipse 4.4**.

*Note*: Anypoint Studio supports http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[JDK 7] only.

Further, ensure that you have all the JARs your project requires, and ensure that you have adjusted their scope from "provided" to "compile" in Maven.
