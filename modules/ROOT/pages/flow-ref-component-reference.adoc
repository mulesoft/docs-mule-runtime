= Flow Ref Component Reference
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Use a *flow reference* component in flow to direct Mule to send a message to another flow for processing. When a message reaches a flow reference component in a flow, Mule sends the message to another flow according to the configuration of the `flow-ref` attributes.

[NOTE]
Note that when Mule passes a message to another flow via a flow reference, the message is not carried via a transport. Thus, any outbound properties on the message will remain outbound properties rather than being converted into inbound properties (as they would be if the message crossed the transport barrier.)

A flow reference can route messages to any type of flow within the same application.

== Configuration
