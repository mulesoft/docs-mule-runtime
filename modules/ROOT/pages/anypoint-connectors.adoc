**Anypoint Connectors** facilitate easy integration of your Mule applications with third-party APIs and standard integration protocols. Use connectors within your application's flows to send and receive data using a protocol or specific API.

Anypoint Connectors are automatically bundled with Anypoint Studio, and there is a large library of additional connectors available for download in https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?type=connector[Anypoint Exchange]. You can also create a xref:3.7@publishing-and-consuming-apis-with-mule.adoc[REST or SOAP API connector], or create your own connectors using xref:3.8@connector-devkit::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector DevKit]. For more information on integration solutions, see the http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/cloud-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] product site.

Import additional connectors into your Studio instance, or create applications using connectors outside of Studio by adding them as Maven dependencies or including connector libraries with your project.


== Types of Connectors

All connectors can function as *endpoints* by sending and receiving messages between flows or between a flow and some other data source outside of Mule. Some connectors are *endpoint-based*, meaning that you configure them either as inbound or outbound endpoints in your flow, then specify other operation logic within the configuration of that endpoint. Some connectors are *operation-based*, meaning that they allow you to invoke specific actions against an API, Web service, or database.

Terminology

In previous versions of Mule, endpoint-based connectors were sometimes referred to as transports. Also the term connectors was used for both the global connection configuration for an endpoint and for Mule-specific  extensions (also called Cloud Connectors) for third-party APIs.

As of Mule 3.5, we are clarifying the terminology as follows.

*Transport:* Transports provide connectivity to a data source or message channel by implementing one of a variety of standard connection protocols that are bundled with Mule. Endpoint-based connectors are often constructed around a transport.

*Connector:* A connector is a Mule-specific connection to an external resource of any kind, whether it is a generic protocol such as HTTP, FTP, or a Java-based database, or a specific third-party API, such as Salesforce or Workday. Connectors may be operation-based or endpoint-based, but this distinction refers to a difference in configuration details, not in functionality.

*Endpoint:* An endpoint is a flow-level element that is configured to receive and/or send messages from and/or to external resources. Any connector (whether endpoint-based or operation-based) can function as an endpoint, but some connectors can only act as *inbound endpoints*, others can only act as *outbound endpoints.*

== Endpoint-Based Connector Communication

Depending on its location in a flow, a endpoint-based connector may function as an *inbound endpoint* or *outbound endpoint.*


Note that an endpoint is a functional concept in Mule, not a rigid category. Endpoint-based connectors are always configured as either an inbound endpoint or an outbound endpoint, but operation-based connectors may also function as endpoints.

*Inbound Endpoints*

When a connector is configured as an inbound endpoint, it is acting as a *message source*. A message source receives new messages from a channel or resource, thus triggering the execution of a flow. A connector configured as an inbound endpoint reads the data it receives, packages the content as a message, then passes it to the first message processor in a Mule flow. A message source can receive data by:

* Using a server socket
* Polling a remote socket or resource
* Registering a listener

Inbound endpoints use one of two *message exchange patterns* (MEPs) in a Mule flow.

* An inbound endpoint with a *one-way* exchange pattern simply accepts information from an external source for processing by Mule. For example, an JMS endpoint would use a one-way exchange pattern to accept messages from an external queue and process them in Mule (the queue doesn't expect a post-processing response).
* An inbound endpoint with a *request-response* exchange pattern not only accepts information from an external source, it also returns a response to the external source that "called" the Mule flow. For example, an HTTP endpoint might use a request-response exchange pattern to accept a Web service request from a caller, then return a response after Mule has processed the message.

*Outbound Endpoints*

*Outbound endpoints* send messages from Mule to an external system or application. Outbound endpoints can exist either in the middle of a flow or at the end of a Mule flow, sending a message out to an external system after Mule has processed the message to transform it, enrich it, or otherwise act upon it.

Outbound endpoints may also use one of two *message exchange patterns*:

* An outbound endpoint with a *one-way* exchange pattern simply receives the message payload and routing instructions from the message processor which precedes it in a flow, then sends the message to its destination. For example, an SMTP connector, which can only be configured as a one-way, outbound endpoint, sends the message it receives from the Mule flow as an email using the SMTP protocol to a destination and does not expect a response.
* An outbound endpoint with a *request-response* exchange pattern not only sends information to an external resource, it also returns the external resource's response to the Mule flow. For example, a VM connector might use a request-response exchange pattern to send a message to another flow via a VM queue, then that second flow would process the message and return it back to the first flow after its processing is complete.

image::mep-ways-rr.png[mep_ways-rr]

2+|Operation-based connectors do not have these indicators, as their message exchange pattern varies according to the specific operation that you select for the connector.
|===
====

===  Operation-Based Connector Communication

Many connectors are *operation-based*, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform. For example, when you add a Salesforce connector to your flow, the first configuration you need to define is the operation. The XML element of the operation-based connector differs according to the operation that you select, taking the form `<connectorname>:<operation>`. For example, `sfdc:query` or `sfdc:upsert-bulk`. The remaining configuration attributes or child elements are determined by the operation that you select.

Operation-based connectors require a global connector configuration (usually optional for endpoint-based connectors) to specify the connection parameters such as username, passwords, and security token. Additional global parameters may also be configured. For details, see the individual references for each connector. General instructions are available on the xref:anypoint-connectors.adoc[Connector Configuration Reference].

Note that endpoint-based connectors also perform operations on resources, but in most cases the protocol itself defines what that operation is. For example, the SMTP connector always sends an email, so the "send" operation is built into the protocol itself. In cases where a protocol supports multiple operations, the configuration of the operation is done via attributes or child elements of the connector, rather than in the connector element itself. For example, an `http:outbound-endpoint` may have an `attribute method="GET"`, which defines what operation you are performing over the HTTP protocol.

== Installing Additional Connectors

MuleSoft and members of the Mule community have developed dozens of additional connectors that you can use in your applications. Refer to the xref:installing-connectors.adoc[Installing Connectors] documentation to learn how to download and install connectors in Anypoint Studio.

If you are developing your applications in an XML editor outside of Anypoint Studio, you can add jars manually or add Anypoint Connectors as Maven dependencies. To make the connector available to a Mavenized Mule application, add the connector repositories to your pom.xml file, add the module as a dependency, and add it to the packaging process of your applications.

You can find the latest installation links and instructions for each connector on the connector-specific reference pages, accessible from the connectors site.

== Beyond Existing Connectors

If none of the connectors on the connectors site meet your needs, you have several options:

* Contact MuleSoft and the community via the http://forums.mulesoft.com[forum] – either MuleSoft or a member of the community might be in the process of building the connector you need or can point you to a community-built connector hosted elsewhere.
* Consider building your own. Check out the xref:3.8@connector-devkit::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector DevKit] documentation for more information.

Note that many connectors facilitate connectivity via a standard format or protocol. For example, if you are connecting to an Oracle database or a MS SQLServer database, you can use the xref:database-connector.adoc[Database Connector], because those databases output their data in a standard format. There is no need for an Oracle-specific or MS SQLServer-specific connector. Similarly, you can use the xref:web-service-consumer.adoc[Web Service Consumer Connector] to consume any SOAP-based web service, so you may not need a specific connector if the Web Service Consumer satisfies your use case.

== Configuring Connectors

For configuration information specific to individual connectors, refer to the Reference column of the table above. If the connector you are interested in using is not bundled in Studio, refer to the documentation linked on the connectors site.

For general configuration instructions for connectors, see the Connector xref:connector-configuration-reference.adoc[Configuration Reference].

== Connector Compatibility

*Operations-Based*

Starting with (and including) Mule 3.2, MuleSoft has made all operations-based connectors forward-compatible with all new releases of Mule. This group of connectors, which are referred to as *3.2-compatible* or *Studio-compatible*, can be configured either through the Properties pane in Anypoint Studio's visual interface or through an XML editor.

Connectors developed prior to Mule ESB 3.2 can be deployed only with the version of Mule for which they were developed. In other words, these legacy operation-based connectors are neither forward nor backward-compatible.

Legacy connectors cannot be configured or deployed using Studio. Instead, you must configure all legacy connectors with an XML editor, then deploy them exclusively with the Mule release for which they are listed as compatible.

*Endpoint-Based*

Because endpoint-based connectors are constructed around transports that are bundled with the Mule distribution, they are tied directly to a Mule version. When you develop a Mule application for the Mule 3.5.0 Runtime, for example, the endpoint-based connectors included in your project are tied to the Mule 3.5.0 core code.
