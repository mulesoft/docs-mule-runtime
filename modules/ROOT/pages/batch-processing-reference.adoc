== Terminology

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Term |Description |Element
|*Batch* |A group of records which Mule processes individually, by record. |n/a
|*Batch Commit* |A scope which accumulates records into chunks to prepare bulk upserts to external source or service. |`batch:commit`
|*Batch Job* |The top-level element in an application in which Mule processes a message payload as a batch of records. The term batch job is inclusive of all four phases of processing: Input, Load and Dispatch, Process, and On Complete. |`batch:job`
|*Batch Job Instance* |An occurrence in a Mule application resulting from the execution of a batch job in a Mule flow. Mule creates the batch job instance in the Load and Dispatch phase, and the instance exists eternally. |n/a
|*Batch Job Result* |POJO which contains information about the processing results of a batch job instance. You can use it to get information about execution progress. |`BatchJobResult`
|*Batch Message Processor* |An element in a Mule flow which triggers execution of a batch job. |`batch:execute`
|*Batch Phase* |Sequentially ordered stages through which batches pass as Mule processes them. |`batch:input` +
 `batch:process-records` +
 `batch:on-complete `
|*Batch Step* |A child element of the batch job within which multiple message processors act upon records in a batch. |`batch:step`
|*Record* |A small part of a large message's payload; a single instance of the result of Mule's action to split a serialized message payload (i.e. a collection or array) into pieces for processing. |n/a

== Batch Commit Connectors

Several *Anypoint Connectors* have the ability to handle record-level errors without failing a whole batch commit (i.e. upsert). At runtime, these connectors keep track of which records were successfully accepted by the target resource, and which failed to upsert.  Thus, rather than failing a complete group of records during a commit activity, the connector simply upserts as many records as it can, and tracks any failures for notification. The short – but soon to grow – list of such connectors follows:

* Salesforce
* Google Contacts
* Google Calendars
* NetSuite

== BatchJobResult Processing Statistics

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Statistic |Description
|`batchJobInstanceId` |A String indicating the id of the executed job instance.
|`elapsedTimeInMillis` |A long indicating the number of milliseconds the batch job spent in executing state.
|`failedOnCompletePhase` |A boolean indicating whether an exception was found on the on the complete phase.
|`failedOnInputPhase` |A boolean indicating whether an exception was found on the on the input phase.
|`failedOnLoadingPhase` |A boolean indicating whether an exception was found on the on the input phase.
|`failedRecords` |A long indicating the number of records that failed processing.
|`inputPhaseException` |If an exception was found in the input phase, then that Exception is returned; otherwise `null` is returned. Notice that there's a correlation between this statistic and failedOnInputPhase.
|`loadedRecords` |A long indicating the number of records loaded so far. Once the loading phase is completed, it should be equal to totalRecords.
|`loadingPhaseException` |If an exception was found in the loading phase, then that Exception is returned; otherwise `null` is returned. Notice that there's a correlation between this statistic and failedOnLoadingPhase.
|`onCompletePhaseException` |If an exception was found in the on complete phase, then that Exception is returned; otherwise `null` is returned. Notice that there's a correlation between this statistic and failedOnCompletePhase.
|`processedRecords` |A long indicating the number of records processed so far. It equals successfulRecords failedRecords, but it could be lower than totalRecords if the job is not finished.
|`successfulRecords` |A long indicating the number of records processed so far.
|`totalRecords` |Total number of records in the batch.

== Example

[NOTE]
 For a *full description* of the example and steps the batch job takes in each phase of processing, see xref:batch-processing.adoc[Batch Processing].

[NOTE]
====
If you copy + paste the code into your instance of Studio, be sure to enter your own values for the the *global Salesforce connector*:

* username
* password
* security token

How do I get a Salesforce security token?

. Log in to your Salesforce account. From your account menu (your account is labeled with your name), select *Setup*.

. In the left navigation bar, under the *My Settings* heading, click to expand the **Personal **folder.

. Click *Reset My Security Token*. Salesforce resets the token and emails you the new one.

. Access the email that Salesforce sent and copy the new token onto your local clipboard.

. In the application in your instance of Anypoint Studio, click the *Global Elements* tab.

. Double-click the Salesforce global element to open its *Global Element Properties* panel. In the *Security Token* field, paste the new Salesforce token you copied from the email. Alternatively, configure the global element in the XML Editor.
