The CORS Validate component allows you to perform CORS validation directly from the flow of your Mule Application, without the need of setting a CORS policy in front of your API.

This component adds the necessary CORS headers to the response. +
If the request to your application is not a CORS request, then the processing continues without altering the message. +
If the request method is OPTIONS, this component does not perform further processing of the message.
