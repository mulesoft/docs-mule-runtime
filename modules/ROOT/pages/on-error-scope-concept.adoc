= On-Error Components
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

When an error occurs in a Mule app, an Error Handler component routes the error
to the first On-Error component (On Error Continue or On Error Propagate)
configuration that matches the Mule error, such as `HTTP:NOT_FOUND`,
`DB:CONNECTIVITY`, or `ANY` (the default for all Mule errors). If no error handling
is configured for the error, the app follows a
xref:error-handling.adoc#default_error_handling[default error handling] process.

== On-Error Components Behavior

On-Error components differ in the way they affect their _owner_,
that is, the Flow or Try scope where they are defined. Also, On-Error components can be defined inside a Global Error Handler, affecting the entire Mule application.

=== On Error Propagate

Executes but propagates the error to a higher level, such as a containing
scope (for example, to a Flow that contains a Try scope where the error occurs)
or external flow containing a Flow Reference to the flow in which an error occurs.
The error breaks the owner's execution and propagates to that higher level,
causing a failure at that level. In addition, any transaction the owner handles
is rolled back. However, note that the transaction is not rolled back if another
component (one that does not own On Error Propagate) created the transaction.

=== On Error Continue

Executes and uses the result of the execution as the result of its owner,
as if the owner completed the execution successfully. Any transaction the
owner handles is committed. However, note that the transaction is not committed
if another component (one that does not own On Error Continue) created the
transaction.

== Error Matching

To help you identify and handle potential errors when designing a Mule app,
On-Error components list the errors that the runtime engine and operations
configured in the app can throw. You can select the errors you want to handle.

* Matching based on error type:
+
On-Error components can perform matching based on
xref:mule-error-concept.adoc#error_types[error types] you select. The list of
selectable error types depends on the module and connector operations within the
flow or scope to which the On-Error component applies. It also lists `EXPRESSION`
and `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` errors, which the runtime can throw.
+
image:mruntime-on-error-type-selection.png[]
+
* Matching based on a condition (for more advanced use cases):
+
You can perform error matching based on a `when` condition that you define in the
*When* field of an On-Error component. For example, you might map the component
to fatal errors, which have error messages that contain the word "fatal":
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<on-error-continue
  enableNotifications="true" logException="true"
  type="ANY"
  when='error.cause.message contains "fatal"'/>
----
+
In the example, every error that matches the `when` expression is handled by `on-error-continue`. You can also add a restrictive type such as `type="HTTP:CONNECTIVITY"` so that the error handler handles only the errors that match the specified type and condition.

Note that matching conditions are evaluated sequentially, in the order in
which the On-Error components reside in the error handler. For example, if
you want to handle `VALIDATION:NOT_NULL` in one way but handle all other
errors a different way, provide an On-Error component configuration
for that error before a component that captures the remaining errors
(identified as `ANY` by the second On-Error component). Remember that
default error handling takes place for errors you do not explicitly match
or use ANY to capture.

== Configuration and Use

In most cases, you configure On-Error components within the scope-like Error
Handler component. Though each flow contains only one built-in Error Handler,
the Error Handler can contain as many On-Error components as you require, and
each On-Error component can contain any number of other components, such as
Loggers and other components that you configure to handle errors captured by
the On-Error component.

Because an Error Handler component is built into Flow and Try components, you
can use On-Error components for errors that occur within the scope of a flow or
within a Try component. For examples, see
xref:error-handling.adoc#on_error_continue[Using On-Error Components to Handle Messaging Errors].

You can also use On-Error components in a separate Error Handler configuration
that is referenced from a Flow component or Try scope (see
xref:error-handling#global_error_handler[Referencing a Global Error Handler]).

By default, On-Error components also log matching errors and enable error
notifications for occurrences of the errors. You can disable these settings by modifying the component properties in Studio or by editing the configuration XML.
You can also configure notification listeners in your Mule application so that they can react to the notification events.

[[flow_error_config]]
=== Error Handling within a Flow

Within a flow's built-in Error Handler component, you can set up one or more
On-Error components to match error types and expressions. The following example
outlines the general structure for handling errors that occur within a given
flow. One flow uses On Error Continue (`on-error-continue`) in its Error Handler
component. The other flow uses On Error Propagate (`on-error-propagate`).

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="catch">
  <!-- flow logic -->
  <error-handler>
    <on-error-continue>
      <!-- error handling logic -->
    </on-error-continue>
  </error-handler>
</flow>

<flow name="rollback">
  <!-- flow logic -->
  <error-handler>
    <on-error-propagate>
      <!-- error handling logic -->
    </on-error-propagate>
  </error-handler>
</flow>
----

For examples, see
xref:error-handling.adoc#on_error_continue[Using On-Error Components to Handle Messaging Errors].


=== Reuse of On-Error Scopes

Just as you can share error handlers by exposing them globally and referencing
them in flows and try scopes, you can also reuse On-Error components. You can
define and name an On-Error component globally and then reference from an
Error Handler component.

.Example: XML Configuration for Referenced On-Error
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<on-error-propagate name="sharedPropagateHandler">
  <logger message="An unhandled error has occurred."/>
</on-error-propagate>

<on-error-continue type="EXPRESSION" name="sharedContinueHandler">
  <logger message="An expression failed to evaluate."/>
</on-error-continue>

<error-handler name="reusingHandlers">
  <on-error ref="sharedContinueHandler"/>
  <on-error-continue type="ROUTING">
    <logger message="An expression failed to evaluate."/>
  </on-error-continue>
  <on-error ref="sharedPropagateHandler"/>
</error-handler>
----

For other reuse examples, see
xref:error-handling.adoc#global_error_handler[Referencing a Global Error Handler].

== Error Handling Example

The following error handlers are configured to produce
`{ "MyError": "value was expected to be null" }` for a `VALIDATION:NOT_NULL`
error, rather than `{ "messageANY" : "Some other error" }`. The string
`value was expected to be null` is the description of the
`VALIDATION:NOT_NULL` error. The Is Null component can throw this error.
Is Null belongs to the Validation module.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<error-handler >
  <on-error-continue
    enableNotifications="true"
    logException="true"
    type="VALIDATION:NOT_NULL">
    <ee:transform >
      <ee:message>
        <ee:set-payload><![CDATA[%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
MyError : error.description as String
}]]></ee:set-payload>
      </ee:message>
    </ee:transform>
  </on-error-continue>
  <on-error-continue
    enableNotifications="true"
    logException="true"
    type="ANY">
    <ee:transform>
      <ee:message >
        <ee:set-payload ><![CDATA[%dw 2.0

{
"messageANY" : "Some other error"
}
]]></ee:set-payload>
      </ee:message>
    </ee:transform>
  </on-error-continue>
</error-handler>
