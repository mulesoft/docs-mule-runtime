Mule has the ability to encrypt a message payload, or part of a payload, using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). PGP combines data compression and data encryption to secure messages. The compression reduces message transmission time between origin and destination.

Pretty Good Privacy uses a variation of the public key system. In this system, each user has an encryption key that is publicly known and a private key that is known only to that user. You encrypt a message you send to someone else using their public key. When they receive it, they decrypt it using their private key. Since encrypting an entire message can be time-consuming, PGP uses a faster encryption algorithm to encrypt the message and then uses the public key to encrypt the shorter key that was used to encrypt the entire message. Both the encrypted message and the short key are sent to the receiver who first uses the receiver's private key to decrypt the short key and then uses that key to decrypt the message.

PGP Encrypter widely used option as part of ESB (Enterprise Service Bus). Sender can transform the message in secured way without bothering about security concerns.

There are two scenarios that this document addresses:

* using another party's public key to *encrypt* a messages in a Mule application
* using one's own set of private and public keys so as to accept, and *decrypt* messages in a Mule application

The sections below outline the steps involved in encrypting or decrypting messages using PGP in Mule.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are reasonably familiar with PGP encryption, and the concept of public and private keys. For more details on encryption in general, and PGP in particular.

== Encrypting

In the world of PGP encryption, the sender of a message must encrypt its contents using the receiver's public key. Thus, where your Mule flow handles messages that it must encrypt with someone else's public key, you'll need to add the receiver's public key to your "key ring" in Mule. Essentially, Mule stores asks the user for the key ring file which the Message Encryption message processor accesses to encrypt the any part of your message before sending.

. Use a tool such as GPG Keychain Access to import the other party's public key. Refer to section below for more details about using GPG to facilitate implementation of PGP encryption and decryption in Mule.
. Using the same tool, *export* the public key, selecting binary as the output format. This produces a key ring file with a `.gpg` extension.
. Ensure that the `.gpg` file is stored in a place that the Mule application can access it at runtime; record the filepath of the `.gpg` file (also known as your public key ring file).
. In your Mule application, create a global *Encryption* element, specifying a name for the element; change the default value for the *Default Encrypter* to `PGP_ENCRYPTER`. (See image below, left.)
. On the *Pgp Encrypter* tab, configure the fields (see image below, right) according to the table below. +

== Decrypting

In the world of PGP encryption, the receiver of a message must be prepared to use a private key to decrypt its contents which were encrypted with a public key. Therefore, the receiver of an encrypted message must first generate a set of PGP keys:

* a *public key* to distribute to those who will use it to encrypt and send messages to you
* a *private key* to decrypt the messages you receive which were encrypted using the public key

Thus, where your Mule flow receives messages that it must decrypt using your own private key, you must complete the following steps:

. Generate a set of keys.
. Send the public key out to those who will send you encrypted messages.
. Set a message encryption processor in your Mule flow that uses the private key to decrypt messages it receives.

Mule itself does not generate sets of keys, nor distribute public keys. Access the *Generating PGP Keys* section below to learn more about key generation; otherwise, if you already have your keys, proceed to the instructions directly below to set up a message encryption processor in your Mule flow.

=== Generating PGP Keys

You can use a tool such as GPG Keychain Access to create a new set of keys in the application (see screenshot below) or from the command line, answering questions to customize and identify your keys (see code sample below). Best practice recommends using the same key size – 1536 bits or 2048 bits – in all your environments (development, QA and production).

When it has completed the operation, the key generation tool adds your new public key to a system wide public key ring, and adds your private key to a parallel system-wide private key ring. The next step is to identify the filepath of the key rings so as to make them available for Mule to access.

* find the public key ring file (`pubring.gpg`) on your local drive
* find the private key ring file (`secring.gpg`)
* *Mac or Unix**: located in the _hidden_ `.gnupg` folder on your local drive
* *Windows**: location varies according to your local configuration, but may be at a location similar to `C:/Users/myuser/AppData/Roaming/gnupg`

=== Determining the Numeric Value of the Secret Alias ID

To configure your message encryption processor in Mule, you must be in possession of the Secret Alias ID (i.e. the public key). Determining the numeric value for the Secret Alias Id is somewhat complex as its numeric value isn't accessible via the key ring file or within the GPG utility. You can, however, employ a trick to discover the secret alias ID: assign a random value, such as "1", to the Secret Alias Id in the message encryption processor in your Mule flow, then run the application to let Mule throw an error on purpose. In the exception thrown from the Console output, Mule displays a message indicating the keys you can use. See image below.
