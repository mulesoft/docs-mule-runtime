http://www.jboss.org/jbpm[JBoss jBPM] is a best-of-breed open source BPMS and is well-integrated with Mule. One advantage of jBPM is that it is embedded directly in the Mule runtime, allowing for faster performance. For general information on jBPM and how to configure it, refer to the http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v4/userguide/html_single/[jBPM User Guide].

[WARNING]
This module provides a "Plug-in" for JBoss jBPM to be used with Mule's BPM support. If you have not yet read the general documentation for Mule's xref:bpm-module-reference.adoc[BPM Support], please read that first and then come back to this page.

----

== Features

* Simple declaration of jBPM as the BPMS in your Mule configuration using sensible defaults.
* Custom elements for jBPM's process definition language (jPDL) which allow you to easily integrate Mule into your business processes.

Refer to xref:bpm-module-reference.adoc[BPM Module Reference] for a list of general features offered by Mule's BPM support.

[NOTE]
The jBPM libraries are bundled with the Mule distribution. As of Mule 3.0.1, jBPM 4.4 is the latest supported version.

== Usage

Using jBPM with Mule consists of a few things:

* Configuring jBPM
* Configuring Hibernate and the database used to store process state
* Declaring jBPM as the BPMS to use in your Mule configuration
* Interacting with Mule from your process definition

=== jBPM Configuration

The default configuration file for jBPM is called `jbpm.cfg.xml`. You need to include this file as part of your Mule application. If defaults are ok for you, then it could be as simple as the following.

*jBPM Configuration (jbpm.cfg.xml)*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jbpm-configuration>
    <import resource="jbpm.default.cfg.xml" />
    <import resource="jbpm.jpdl.cfg.xml" />
    <import resource="jbpm.tx.hibernate.cfg.xml" />

    <process-engine-context>
        <object class="org.mule.module.jbpm.MuleMessageService" /> //<1>
    </process-engine-context>
</jbpm-configuration>
----

<1> Note that you need to define the MuleMessageService within `<process-engine-context>` otherwise jBPM cannot "see" Mule.

=== Database Configuration

jBPM uses Hibernate to persist the state of your processes, so you need to provide a http://community.jboss.org/wiki/SupportedDatabases[database supported by Hibernate] and include any client jars as part of your Mule application. You also need to provide the file `jbpm.hibernate.cfg.xml` with the appropriate Hibernate settings for your chosen database.

For example, a simple in-memory http://db.apache.org/derby/[Derby] database might use these settings:

*Derby settings*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.DerbyDialect</property>
  <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</property>
  <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:derby:memory:muleEmbeddedDB</property>
  <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">create-drop</property>
----

While an Oracle database uses these settings:

*Oracle settings*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.OracleDialect</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:oracle:thin:user/pass@server:1521:dbname</property>
----

One very important Hibernate setting to pay attention to is `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto`. If this is set to `create`, Hibernate automatically creates the DB schema for jBPM at startup if it does not yet exist in your database. If it is set to `create-drop`, the schema also deletes at shutdown, which is useful in test environments.

=== Mule Configuration

Using jBPM in your Mule configuration is then as simple as including the `<bpm:jbpm>` element. The default configuration file is assumed to be `jbpm.cfg.xml`, otherwise you can specify it with the `configurationResource` attribute.

*Default config*

----
<bpm:jbpm />
----

*Custom config*

----
<bpm:jbpm name="jBPM" configurationResource="custom-jbpm-config.cfg.xml"/>
----

=== Process Definition (jPDL)

For lack of a good standard in the BPM community, jBPM has traditionally used its own DSL for process definitions called http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v4/userguide/html_single/#jpdl[jPDL]. It is very easy to learn, and there is an http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v4/userguide/html_single/#graphicalprocessdesigner[Eclipse plug-in] called the Graphical Process Designer, which allows you to create your process definitions visually as well.

[WARNING]
In future versions, the preferred definition language will likely be http://community.jboss.org/wiki/jBPMBPMN[BPMN 2.0], which is now a widely-accepted standard in the BPM community. Mule currently support BPMN-defined processes through the Activiti BPM Module.

Mule provides two custom elements for jBPM's process definition language (jPDL). You can use these in your process definition along with other http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v4/userguide/html_single/#jpdl[standard jPDL elements] such as `<state>, <java>, <script>, <decision>` .

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Element |Description
|<mule-send> |Activity which sends a message with the payload *`expr`* to the Mule *endpoint*. If *exchange-pattern* = request-response (the default value), the send blocks and the response message is stored into *var*. If the message is not of *type*, an exception is thrown. *expr* can be a literal value or an http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnahq.html[expression] which references process variables. The only mandatory attributes are *expr* and *endpoint*, the rest are optional.

*Usage*:

----
<mule-send expr="" endpoint="" exchange-pattern="" var="" type="">
----
|<mule-receive> |Wait state which expects a message to arrive from the Mule *endpoint* and stores it into *var*. If the message is not of *type*, an exception is thrown. `<mule-receive>` can replace `<start>` as the first state of a process and this way you can store the message which initiated the process into a variable. The attributes are all optional.


*Usage*:

----
<mule-receive var="" endpoint="" type="">
----

        <bpm:process processName="LoanBroker" processDefinition="loan-broker-process.jpdl.xml" /> //<4>
    </flow>
    ...cut...
</mule>
----

<1> Import the BPM schema.
<2> Declare jBPM as the BPMS implementation to use.
<3> Incoming messages on these endpoints start/advance the process and are stored as process variables.
<4> The process defined in loan-broker-process.jpdl.xml gets deployed to jBPM at startup.

*Example jPDL Process Definition*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<process name="LoanBroker" xmlns="http://www.jbpm.org/4.3/jpdl">

    <mule-receive name="incomingCustomerRequest" endpoint="CustomerRequests" type="foo.messages.CustomerQuoteRequest" var="customerRequest">
        <transition to="sendToCreditAgency" />
    </mule-receive> //<1>

    <mule-send name="sendToCreditAgency"
          expr="#{customerRequest.customer}" endpoint="CreditAgency" exchange-pattern="one-way">

    <decision name="sendToBanks"> //<3>
        <transition to="sendToBigBank">
            <condition expr="#{customerRequest.loanAmount >= 20000}" /> //<4>
        </transition>
        <transition to="sendToMediumBank">
            <condition expr="#{customerRequest.loanAmount >= 10000}" />
        </transition>
        ...cut...
    </decision>

    ...cut...
    <end name="loanApproved" />
</process>
----

<1> An incoming message is expected on the endpoint `CustomerRequests` of type `foo.messages.CustomerQuoteRequest` and is stored into the process variable `customerRequest`.
<2> A new message is sent to the endpoint `CreditAgency` whose payload is an expression using the process variable `customerRequest`.
<3> `<decision>` is a standard jPDL element.
<4> The decision logic uses the process variable `customerRequest`.
