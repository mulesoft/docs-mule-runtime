== Introduction

http://www.jboss.org/jbpm[JBoss jBPM] is an open source BPMS and is well-integrated with Mule. One advantage of jBPM is that it is embedded directly in the Mule runtime, allowing for faster performance.

[WARNING]
This module provides a "Plug-in" for JBoss jBPM to be used with Mule's BPM support. If you have not yet read the general documentation for Mule's xref:bpm-module-reference.adoc[BPM Support], please read that first and then come back to this page.

== Namespace and Syntax

XML namespace:

[source,text,linenums]
----
xmlns:bpm "http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/bpm"
----

XML Schema location:

[source,text,linenums]
----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/bpm/3.2/mule-bpm.xsd
----

Syntax:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bpm:jbpm /><bpm:process processName="myProcess" processDefinition="my-process.jpdl.xml" />
----

== Features

* Simple declaration of jBPM as the BPMS in your Mule configuration using sensible defaults.
* Custom elements for jBPM's process definition language (jPDL) which allow you to easily integrate Mule into your business processes.

Refer to xref:bpm-module-reference.adoc[BPM Module Reference] for a list of general features offered by Mule's BPM support.

To see jBPM with Mule in action, take a look at the xref:loan-broker-bpm-example.adoc[Loan Broker BPM Example] (available in the full Mule distribution).

[TIP]
The jBPM libraries are bundled with the Mule distribution. As of Mule 3.0.1, jBPM 4.4 is the latest supported version.

== Usage

Using jBPM with Mule consists of a few things:

* Configuring jBPM
* Configuring Hibernate and the database used to store process state
* Declaring jBPM as the BPMS to use in your Mule configuration
* Interacting with Mule from your process definition

=== jBPM Configuration

The default configuration file for jBPM is called `jbpm.cfg.xml`. You will need to include this file as part of your Mule application. If defaults are ok for you, then it could be as simple as the following.

*jBPM Configuration (jbpm.cfg.xml)*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jbpm-configuration>    <import resource="jbpm.default.cfg.xml" />    <import resource="jbpm.jpdl.cfg.xml" />    <import resource="jbpm.tx.hibernate.cfg.xml" />    <process-engine-context>        <object class="org.mule.module.jbpm.MuleMessageService" /> ❶    </process-engine-context></jbpm-configuration>
----

❶ Note that you need to define the MuleMessageService within `<process-engine-context>` otherwise jBPM will not be able to "see" Mule.

For more configuration options, refer to the http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v3/userguide/configuration.html[jBPM documentation].

=== Database Configuration

jBPM uses Hibernate to persist the state of your processes, so you will need to provide a http://community.jboss.org/wiki/SupportedDatabases[database supported by Hibernate] and include any client jars as part of your Mule application. You also need to provide the file `jbpm.hibernate.cfg.xml` with the appropriate Hibernate settings for your chosen database.

For example, a simple in-memory http://db.apache.org/derby/[Derby] database might use these settings:

*Derby settings*

[source,text,linenums]
----
  <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.DerbyDialect</property>  <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</property>  <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:derby:memory:muleEmbeddedDB</property>  <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">create-drop</property>
----

while an Oracle database might use these settings:

*Oracle settings*

[source,text,linenums]
----
  <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.OracleDialect</property>  <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver</property>  <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:oracle:thin:user/pass@server:1521:dbname</property>
----

One very important Hibernate setting to pay attention to is `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto`. If this is set to `create`, Hibernate will automatically create the DB schema for jBPM at startup if it does not yet exist in your database. If it is set to `create-drop`, the schema will also be deleted at shutdown, which is useful in test environments.

For more configuration options, refer to the http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v3/userguide/configuration.html[jBPM documentation] and/or http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.6/reference/en-US/html_single/#configuration-xmlconfig[Hibernate documentation].

=== Mule configuration

Using jBPM in your Mule configuration is then as simple as including the `<bpm:jbpm>` element. The default configuration file is assumed to be `jbpm.cfg.xml`, otherwise you can specify it with the `configurationResource` attribute.

*Default config*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bpm:jbpm />
----

*Custom config*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bpm:jbpm name="jBPM" configurationResource="custom-jbpm-config.cfg.xml"/>
----

=== Process definition (jPDL)

For lack of a good standard in the BPM community, jBPM has traditionally used its own DSL for process definitions called jPDL. You will find that it is very easy to learn, and there is an http://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/v4/userguide/html_single/#graphicalprocessdesigner[Eclipse plug-in] called the Graphical Process Designer which allows you to create your process definitions visually as well.

[WARNING]
In future versions, the preferred definition language will likely be http://community.jboss.org/wiki/jBPMBPMN[BPMN 2.0], which is now a widely-accepted standard in the BPM community. Mule currently support BPMN-defined processes through the Activiti BPM Module.

Mule provides two custom elements for jBPM's process definition language (jPDL). You can use these in your process definition along with other standard jPDL elements such as `<state>, <java>, <script>, <decision>`. +

[%header,cols="10a,10a,10a,70a"]
|===
|Element |Usage |Description |Required Attributes
|<mule-send> |`<mule-send expr="" endpoint="" exchange-pattern="" var="" type="">` |Activity which sends a message with the payload *`expr`* to the Mule *endpoint*. If *exchange-pattern* = request-response (the default value), the send will block and the response message will be stored into *var*. If the message is not of *type*, an exception will be thrown. *expr* can be a literal value or an http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnahq.html[expression] which references process variables. |The only mandatory attributes are *expr* and *endpoint*, the rest are optional.
|<mule-receive> |`<mule-receive var="" endpoint="" type="">` |Wait state which expects a message to arrive from the Mule *endpoint* and stores it into *var*. If the message is not of *type*, an exception will be thrown. `<mule-receive>` can replace `<start>` as the first state of a process and this way you can store the message which initiated the process into a variable. |The attributes are all optional.

== Configuration Examples

*Example Mule Configuration*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule ...cut...    xmlns:bpm="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/bpm"    xsi:schemaLocation="...cut...       http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/bpm http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/bpm/3.2/mule-bpm.xsd"> ❶    <bpm:jbpm name="jbpm" /> ❷    <flow name="ToBPMS">        <composite-source>            <inbound-endpoint ref="CustomerRequests" /> ❸            <inbound-endpoint ref="CreditProfiles" />        </composite-source>        <bpm:process processName="LoanBroker" processDefinition="loan-broker-process.jpdl.xml" /> ❹    </flow>    ...cut...</mule>
----

❶ Import the BPM schema. +
❷ Declare jBPM as the BPMS implementation to use. +
❸ Incoming messages on these endpoints start/advance the process and are stored as process variables. +
❹ The process defined in loan-broker-process.jpdl.xml will get deployed to jBPM at startup.

*Example jPDL Process Definition*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<process name="LoanBroker" xmlns="http://jbpm.org/4.3/jpdl">    <mule-receive name="incomingCustomerRequest" endpoint="CustomerRequests" type="foo.messages.CustomerQuoteRequest" var="customerRequest">        <transition to="sendToCreditAgency" />    </mule-receive> ❶    <mule-send name="sendToCreditAgency"          expr="#{customerRequest.customer}" endpoint="CreditAgency" exchange-pattern="one-way">        <transition to="sendToBanks" />    </mule-send> ❷    <decision name="sendToBanks"> ❸        <transition to="sendToBigBank">            <condition expr="#{customerRequest.loanAmount >= 20000}" /> ❹        </transition>        <transition to="sendToMediumBank">            <condition expr="#{customerRequest.loanAmount >= 10000}" />        </transition>        ...cut...    </decision>    ...cut...    <end name="loanApproved" /></process>
----

❶ An incoming message is expected on the endpoint `CustomerRequests` of type `foo.messages.CustomerQuoteRequest` and is stored into the process variable `customerRequest`. +
❷ A new message is sent to the endpoint `CreditAgency` whose payload is an expression using the process variable `customerRequest`. +
❸ `<decision>` is a standard jPDL element. +
❹ The decision logic uses the process variable `customerRequest`.

*Example Mule Configuration with <service>*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule ...cut...  <bpm:jbpm name="jbpm" />   <model>    <service name="ToBPMS"> ❶        <inbound>            <inbound-endpoint ref="CustomerRequests" />             <inbound-endpoint ref="CreditProfiles" />        </inbound>        <bpm:process processName="LoanBroker" processDefinition="loan-broker-process.jpdl.xml" />     </service>    ...cut...  </model></mule>
----

❶ New implementations are recommended to use xref:using-flows-for-service-orchestration.adoc[flows], but Mule 2.x users will be more familiar with services.
