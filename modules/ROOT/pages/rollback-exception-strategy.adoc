= Rollback Exception Strategy
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]

You can define a rollback exception strategy to ensure that a message that throws an exception in a flow is rolled back for reprocessing. Use a rollback exception strategy when you cannot _correct_ an error when it it occurs in a flow. Usually, you use a rollback exception strategy to handle errors that occur in a flow that involves a xref:transaction-management.adoc[transaction]. If the transaction fails — that is, if a message throws an exception while being processed — then the rollback exception strategy rolls back the transaction in the flow. If the inbound endpoint is transactional, Mule delivers the message to the inbound endpoint of the parent flow again to reattempt processing (i.e. message redelivery).

Beyond managing transactional errors, you can use a rollback exception strategy to:

* manage unhandled exceptions (i.e. exceptions which the application fails to catch)
* flows in which messages require redelivery

A rollback exception strategy has the potential to introduce an infinite loop of activity within a flow: a message throws an error, the rollback exception strategy catches the exception and rolls the message back for reprocessing; the message throws an error again, the rollback exception strategy catches the exception again and rolls the message back for reprocessing, and so on.

To avoid this infinite loop and responsibly manage unresolvable errors, you can apply two limitations to a rollback exception strategy:

* define the maximum number of times that the rollback exception strategy will attempt to redeliver the message for processing
* define a flow to handle those messages which exceed the maximum number of redelivery attempts

== Use Rollback Exception Strategy for Transactions

Unlike a xref:catch-exception-strategy.adoc[catch exception strategy] which always commits a failed transaction and consumes the message, a rollback exception strategy gives a message a few attempts to move through the flow successfully before committing a failed transaction and consuming the message.

For example, suppose you have a flow that involves a bank transaction to deposit funds into an account. You configure a rollback exception strategy to handle errors that occur in this flow; when an error occurs during processing — say, a flow-external bank account database is temporarily unavailable — the message throws an exception. The rollback exception strategy catches the exception, and rolls the message back to the beginning of the flow to reattempt processing. During the second attempt at processing, the database is online again and the message successfully reaches the end of the flow.

Mule attempts message redelivery when your flow uses one of the following two types of transports: *transactional* or *reliable*.

* A *transactional* transport _consumes_ a message as it travels through the flow, transforming it to a different object, for example, or enriching it with more data. When a message using a transactional transport throws an exception, a rollback exception strategy rolls back the transaction so the transport can return a message to its original state for reprocessing.

* A *reliable* transport _does not consume_ a message as it travels through the flow until it can ascertain that the message has successfully reached the end of the flow.When a message using a reliable transport throws an exception, the rollback exception strategy discards the partially processed message and instructs the flow to attempt processing the original message again.

[TIP]
====
If your flow involves a *reliable* transport and a rollback exception strategy, you must set the flow’s Processing Strategy to “synchronous”. (Configure the Processing Strategy in the Flow Properties panel.) This is because *reliable* transports do not consume messages, they wait for messages to successfully complete a flow before consuming it; therefore, the flow must process synchronously.

If you deploy a Mule application that contains a flow with an asynchronous processing strategy and a rollback exception strategy configured for message redelivery, the application will fail!

== Use Rollback Exception Strategy for Unhandled Exceptions

At times, message processors in a flow encounter exceptions which they are unable to resolve by performing corrective measures; these types of errors are called "unhanded exceptions." Typically, all unhanded exceptions are handled by Mule's default exception strategy, but you can customize a rollback exception strategy to more efficiently route messages with unhandled exceptions.

Depending on the flow exchange pattern, a rollback exception strategy routes messages with unhanded exceptions in one of two ways:

* When the flow exchange pattern is **one-way**, the rollback exception strategy instructs the inbound endpoint transport to execute corrective actions.
* When the flow exchange pattern is **request-response**, rollback exception strategy changes the payload of a message and returns it to the client.

=== Rollback Exception Strategy vs. Default Exception Strategy

Where once you would have used Mule's default exception strategy to process unhanded exceptions, you can now configure the much improved rollback exception strategy to do so. To demonstrate the advantages rollback exceptions strategy has to offer, it is worthwhile noting some key differences in the methods each strategy employs when routing messages with unhanded exceptions.

Default Exception Strategy:

* stores the exception information in the payload of the message
* returns `null` in the exceptionPayload attributeMessage
* injects `NullPayload` as the message's payload; unable to customize
* records exception information in the exceptionPayload attribute; unable to customize

Rollback Exception Strategy:

* retains the information in the message payload at the time the exception was thrown; does not alter the message payload
* stores the exception information in the exceptionPayload
* returns the message processing result during execution of the exception strategy
* records exception information in the exceptionPayload attribute; able to customize

Where the default exception strategy faltered, rollback exception strategy performs. Using a rollback exception strategy, you can send messages with unhanded exceptions to a dead letter queue, send failure notifications, and change the result of a flow's execution.

== Configuring a Rollback Exception Strategy

Whether your flow involves transactional or reliable transports, you can configure its rollback exception strategy in Mule.

. Drag building blocks from the palette into the *redelivery exhausted* box to build a flow that processes messages which exceed the maximum number of redelivery attempts. For example, you may wish to use redelivery exhausted to direct all “poisoned messages” to a dead letter queue. A redelivery exhausted flow can contain any number of message processors.

[WARNING]
You can define _only one_ exception strategy for each flow. If you need to design a more complex error handling strategy that involves more than one way of handling exceptions, consider using a xref:choice-exception-strategy.adoc[Choice Exception Strategy].

== Configuring Redelivery Attempts in JMS Global Connector

Mule creates a http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Message_digest[digest] of a message’s payload in order to generate a redelivery attempt ID. Mule uses this unique ID as part of its *redelivery policy* which keeps track of the number of message redelivery attempts. (To generate a digest, Mule applies a hash function to the message to obtain a fixed-size bit string that is unique to the message.)

You can use a xref:jms-transport-reference.adoc[JMS global connector]'s redelivery policy to improve the performance of a flow that processes very large or streaming message payloads. Rather than generating a unique ID from a message's (potentially large or streaming) payload, a JMS global connector uses its JMSRedelivery property to keep track of message redelivery attempts.

If your flow uses a JMS global connector, you can configure it to manage the redelivery policy by defining its *Max Redelivery*.

. To your global `jms:connector` element set above all the flows in your Mule project, add a *`maxRedelivery`* attribute and set the value to an integer to define the number of times you want the rollback exception strategy to rollback a message for reprocessing (see code below). Note that if you set the value of the attribute to **`-1`**`,` the JMS global connector’s redelivery policy defers to your rollback exception strategy’s redelivery policy by default.
+
[source,xml,linenums]

<jms:connector name="JMS" validateConnections="true" maxRedelivery="1" doc:name="JMS"/>
----

. To the *`rollback-exception-strategy`* element in your flow, set the value of the `maxRedeliveryAttempts` attribute to "0". Setting to "0" instructs Mule to use the value of maxRedelivery in the global JMS connector's configuration.
. Refer to the table below to learn more about the setting the value of the maxDelivery attributes.

=====

[WARNING]
If your flow uses a JMS global connector and you _do not_ want the connector to manage your rollback strategy’s redelivery policy, then be sure to set the connector’s max redelivery value to `-1`. This ensures that the JMS global connector’s redelivery policy defers to your rollback exception strategy’s redelivery policy by default.

== Creating a Global Rollback Exception Strategy

You can create one or more xref:error-handling.adoc[global exception strategies] to reuse in flows throughout your entire Mule application. First, create a global rollback exception strategy, then add a xref:reference-exception-strategy.adoc[*Reference Exception Strategy*] to a flow to apply the error handling behavior of your new global rollback exception strategy.

. Refer to step 2 <<Configuring a Rollback Exception Strategy>> to configure your global rollback exception strategy.
. Click the *Message Flow* tab below the canvas. On the Message Flow canvas, note that your newly created global rollback exception strategy box appears _outside_ the parent flow. Because it is global, your new rollback exception strategy exists independently of any Mule flow.

=== Applying a Global Rollback Exception Strategy to a Flow

Use a xref:reference-exception-strategy.adoc[reference exception strategy] to instruct a flow to employ the error handling behavior defined by your global rollback exception strategy. In other words, you must ask your flow to refer to the global rollback exception strategy for instructions on how to handle errors.
