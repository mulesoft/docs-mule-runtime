If you need to store runtime data that is available across the application, you can store the data as objects in the Registry. You can get a handle to the Registry from anywhere that you have access to the MuleContext,  as in most Mule entities. For example, you could store the object as follows:

[source,java,linenums]
----
muleContext.getRegistry().registerObject("foo", new MyFoo());
----

You could then update the object from somewhere else:

[source,java,linenums]
----
Foo foo = (Foo) muleContext.getRegistry().lookupObject("foo");
foo.setBarVal(25);
// Replace the previous object
muleContext.getRegistry().registerObject("foo", foo);
----

This approach is useful for storing an object that is needed by multiple components across your application.
