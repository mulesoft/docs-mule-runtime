| Type | Definition | Description

| Any
| `type Any = Any`
| The top-level type. `Any` extends all of the system types, which
means that anything can be assigned to a `Any` typed variable.


| Array
| `type Array = Array`
| Array type that requires a `Type(T)` to represent the elements of the list.
Example: `Array<Number>` represents an array of numbers, and `Array<Any>`
represents an array of any type.


| Binary
| `type Binary = Binary`
| A blob.


| Boolean
| `type Boolean = Boolean`
| A `Boolean` type of `true` or `false`.


| CData
| `type CData = String {cdata: true}`
| XML defines a `CData` custom type that extends from `String` and is used
to identify a CDATA XML block.

It can be used to tell the writer to wrap the content inside CDATA or to
check if the input string arrives inside a CDATA block. `:cdata` inherits
from the type `:string`.

| Comparable
| `type Comparable = String &#124; Number &#124; Boolean &#124; DateTime &#124; LocalDateTime &#124; Date &#124; LocalTime &#124; Time &#124; TimeZone`
| A union type that represents all the types that can be compared to each other.


| Date
| `type Date = Date`
| A date represented by a year, month, and day. For example: `|2018-09-17|`


| DateTime
| `type DateTime = DateTime`
| A `Date` and `Time` within a `TimeZone`. For example: `|2018-09-17T22:13:00Z|`


| Dictionary
| `type Dictionary = { _?: T }`
| Generic dictionary interface.


| Enum
| `type Enum = String {enumeration: true}`
| This type is based on the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Enum.html[Enum Java class].

It must always be used with the `class` property, specifying the full Java
class name of the class, as shown in the example below.

| Iterator
| `type Iterator = Array {iterator: true}`
| This type is based on the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html[iterator Java class].
The iterator contains a collection and includes methods to iterate through
and filter it.

Just like the Java class, `Iterator` is designed to be consumed only once. For
example, if you pass it to a
https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.1/logger-component-reference[Logger component],
the Logger consumes it, so it becomes unreadable by further elements in the flow.


| Key
| `type Key = Key`
| A key of an `Object`.


| LocalDateTime
| `type LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime`
| A `DateTime` in the current `TimeZone`. For example: `|2018-09-17T22:13:00|`


| LocalTime
| `type LocalTime = LocalTime`
| A `Time` in the current `TimeZone`. For example: `|22:10:18|`


| NaN
| `type NaN = Null {NaN: true}`
| `java.lang.Float` and `java.lang.Double` have special cases for `NaN` and `Infinit`.
DataWeave does not have these concepts for its number multi-precision nature.
So when it is mapped to DataWeave values, it is wrapped in a Null with a Schema marker.


| Namespace
| `type Namespace = Namespace`
| A `Namespace` type represented by a `URI` and a prefix.


| Nothing
| `type Nothing = Nothing`
| Bottom type. This type can be assigned to all the types.


| Null
| `type Null = Null`
| A Null type.


| Number
| `type Number = Number`
| A number type: Any number, decimal, or integer is represented by the Number` type.


| Object
| `type Object = Object`
| Type that represents any object, which is a collection of `Key` and value pairs.


| Period
| `type Period = Period`
| A period.


| Range
| `type Range = Range`
| A `Range` type represents a sequence of numbers.


| Regex
| `type Regex = Regex`
| A regex type.


| SimpleType
| `type SimpleType = String &#124; Boolean &#124; Number &#124; DateTime &#124; LocalDateTime &#124; Date &#124; LocalTime &#124; Time &#124; TimeZone &#124; Period`
| A union type that represents all the simple types.


| String
| `type String = String`
| These are the native types of DataWeave.

They are the only types that allow the `???` definition.


| Time
| `type Time = Time`
| A time in a specific `TimeZone`. For example: `|22:10:18Z|`


| TimeZone
| `type TimeZone = TimeZone`
| A time zone.


| Type
| `type Type = Type`
| Represents a type in the DataWeave type system.


| Uri
| `type Uri = Uri`
| A Uri.
