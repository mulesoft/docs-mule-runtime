| Type | Definition | Description

| Any
| `type Any = Any`
| `Any` type, is the top level type. Any extends all of the system types.
That means anything can be assigned to a `Any` typed variable.


| Array
| `type Array = Array`
| `Array` type, requires a Type(T) to represent the elements of the list.
Example: Array<Number> represents an array of numbers.


| Binary
| `type Binary = Binary`
| A Blob


| Boolean
| `type Boolean = Boolean`
| A `Boolean` type `true` of `false`


| CData
| `type CData = String {cdata: true}`
| XML defines a custom type named CData that extends from String and is used
to identify a CDATA XML block.

It can be used to tell the writer to wrap the content inside CDATA or to
check if the input string arrives inside a CDATA block. `:cdata` inherits
from the type `:string`.

| Comparable
| `type Comparable = String &#124; Number &#124; Boolean &#124; DateTime &#124; LocalDateTime &#124; Date &#124; LocalTime &#124; Time &#124; TimeZone`
| A union type that represents all the types that can be compared to each other.


| Date
| `type Date = Date`
| A Date represented by Year Month Day


| DateTime
| `type DateTime = DateTime`
| A Date Time with in a TimeZone


| Dictionary
| `type Dictionary = { _?: T }`
| Generic Dictionary interface


| Enum
| `type Enum = String {enumeration: true}`
| This type is based in the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Enum.html[Enum Java class].

It must always be used with the `class` property, specifying the full Java
class name of the class, as shown in the example below.

| Iterator
| `type Iterator = Array {iterator: true}`
| This type is based in the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html[iterator Java class]. The iterator contains a collection, and includes methods to iterate through and filter it.

[NOTE]
Just like the Java class, the iterator is designed to be consumed only once.
For example, if you then pass this value to a xref:logger-component-reference.adoc[Logger component] would result
in consuming it and it would no longer be readable to further elements
in the flow.


| Key
| `type Key = Key`
| A Key of an Object


| LocalDateTime
| `type LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime`
| A DateTime in the current TimeZone


| LocalTime
| `type LocalTime = LocalTime`
| A Time in the current TimeZone


| Namespace
| `type Namespace = Namespace`
| A namespace type represented by an URI and a Prefix


| Nothing
| `type Nothing = Nothing`
| Bottom type. This type is can be assigned to all the types


| Null
| `type Null = Null`
| A null type


| Number
| `type Number = Number`
| A number any number decimals and integers are represented by `Number` type


| Object
| `type Object = Object`
| `Object` type. Represents any object, collection of Key Value Pairs


| Period
| `type Period = Period`
| A Period


| Range
| `type Range = Range`
| A Range type represents a sequence of numbers


| Regex
| `type Regex = Regex`
| Regex Type


| SimpleType
| `type SimpleType = String &#124; Boolean &#124; Number &#124; DateTime &#124; LocalDateTime &#124; Date &#124; LocalTime &#124; Time &#124; TimeZone &#124; Period`
| A union type that represents all the simple types.


| String
| `type String = String`
| These are the native types of DataWeave.

They are the only types that allow the `???` definition.


| Time
| `type Time = Time`
| A Time in a specific TimeZone


| TimeZone
| `type TimeZone = TimeZone`
| A TimeZone


| Type
