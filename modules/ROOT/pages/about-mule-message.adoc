A Mule message is the part of the Mule event that serves as a container for message content and metadata, typically from external sources, as it is processed within flows of a Mule app.

The Mule message is immutable, so every change to a Mule message results in the creation of a new instance. Each processor in a flow that receives a message returns a new Mule message consisting of these parts:

* A message `payload`, which contains the body of the message. For example: the content of a file, a record from a database, or the response to a REST or Web Service request.
* Message `attributes`, which are metadata associated with the payload.

A Mule message is created as part of a xref:about-mule-event.adoc[Mule event] when a Message source in a Mule flow triggers a flow to start, as when an HTTP listener receives a response or each time the Scheduler component triggers an execution of the flow.

For example, when an HTTP listener in a Mule app receives a response, it creates a Mule event with a Mule message that contains the content of the response as its payload along with the metadata associated with that content, such as HTTP headers, as it attributes. Message processors in the flow (such as Core components, File read operations, or the HTTP request operations) can then retrieve, set, and process Mule message data that resides in the Mule event according to their configurations.

Note that in Anypoint Studio, the xref:7.3@studio::datasense-explorer.adoc[DataSense Explorer] shows the structure of a Mule message at any given point of the flow.

== Message Payload

The message payload contains the content or body of a message. For example, the payload can contain the results of an HTTP request, the content of records you retrieve through the Select operation of the Database connector, or the content of a file that you retrieve through a Read operation to the File or FTP connector.

The payload content changes as it travels through a flow when message processors in a Mule flow set it, enrich it, transform it into a new format, extract information from it, or even store it in a Mule event variable and produce a new payload.

You can select the payload of a Mule message through a DataWeave expression that uses the xref:dataweave-variables-context.adoc[Mule Runtime variable], `payload`.

For example, a Logger component configured to display the `payload` of a response to an HTTP request for the JSON content at `+https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+` outputs the following example JSON content in the Studio console:

.Example: HTTP Response Payload
[source,txt,linenums]

  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Leanne Graham",
    "username": "Bret",

        "lng": "81.1496"
      }
    }
  },

    "username": "Antonette",
    "email": "Shanna@melissa.tv",

        "lng": "-34.4618"
      }
    }
  }
]
----

A Logger component set to display the `payload` for the output of a File Read operation for a simple JSON file can output the following example JSON content in the Studio console:

.Example: File Payload
[source,txt,linenums]
----
{ "hello" : "world" }
----

The next message processor in the flow can then act on this payload, for example, by selecting the value of the JSON object in the payload with `payload.'hello'` to replace the preceding JSON payload with the string, `"world"`.

[[attributes]]
== Attributes

Attributes contain the metadata associated with the body (or payload) of the message. The specific attributes of a message depend on the connector (such as HTTP, FTP, File) associated with the message. Metadata can consist of headers and properties received or returned by a connector, as well as other metadata that is populated by the connector or through a Core component, such as Transform Message.

You can select attributes of a Mule message through a DataWeave expression that uses the xref:dataweave-variables-context.adoc[Mule Runtime variable], `attributes`.

For example, when using the `attributes` variable to display HTTP response metadata through a Logger component, the Studio console outputs the following example HTTP response attributes:

.Example: HTTP Response Attributes
[source,txt,linenums]
----
{
   Status Code=200
   Reason Phrase=OK
   Headers=[
      date=Sun, 20 Jan 2019 19:13:51 GMT
      content-type=text/html;
      charset=UTF-8
      transfer-encoding=chunked
      connection=keep-alive
      set-cookie=__cfduid=d03462713a0b2c57c8d2ad3bf311287041548011631;

   ]
}
----

The example is a response from an HTTP Request operation to the web page `+https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`.

[[select_attribute]]
Notice that each attribute is a key-value pair separated by an equal sign (`=`). When using a connector or component (such as the Logger) in your flow, you can use the `attribute` variable with specific attributes and their inner attributes to select the attribute values that you require, such as the status code or content type. For example, you can select the values of attributes in an HTTP response using the following syntax:

* `attributes.statusCode` to select an HTTP status code like `200`.
* `attributes.headers.date` to select `Sun, 20 Jan 2019 18:54:54 GMT` from the header of an HTTP response.
* `attributes.headers.'content-type'` to select the HTTP content type `application/json`.
+
To select the value of inner attributes like `content-type`, you must surround the name `content-type` in quotes. You do not need quotes around values like `date` because DataWeave applies the rules described in <<valid_identifiers>> to inner values. To understand why you use `statusCode` for the selector instead of `'Status Code'` or `"Status Code"` to select the status code value, see the <<note_top_level_selectors, note>> in that section.

For file metadata, the attributes are different. For example, when using the `attributes` variable to display file metadata through a Logger component, the Studio console displays the following example content:

.Example: File Attributes
[source,txt,linenums]
----
LocalFileAttributes[
  lastModifiedTime=2019-01-20T08:17:55,
  lastAccessTime=2019-01-20T10:54:55,
  creationTime=2019-01-20T08:17:55,
  size=22,
  regularFile=true,
  directory=false,
  symbolicLink=false,
  path=/Users/me/Desktop/myJson.json,
  fileName=myJson.json
----

Notice that each attribute is a key-value pair (such as `fileName=myJson.json`). You can select the value of an attribute by referencing its key, for example:

* `attributes.'fileName'` to return the file name: `myJson.json`.
* `attributes.size` to return the size of the file: `22`.

[[valid_identifiers]]
=== Valid Identifiers for Attribute Names

You can access and declare attribute names that follow the rules described in xref:dataweave-language-introduction.adoc#valid-identifiers[Rules for Declaring Valid Identifiers] without using any quotation marks.

To use an attribute name that is not a valid identifier, surround the attribute name with any of the following characters:

* Single quotation marks (`'`)
* Double quotation marks (`"`)
* Backticks (```)

For example, consider the following DataWeave variable declaration:

[source,java,linenums]
----
var myVar = {
              id : "1234",
              "123 abc !@#" : "some_value"
            }
----

Because attribute name `123 abc !@#` is not a valid identifier, you must use quotation marks or backticks to declare it.

To access the value from attribute `123 abc !@#`, which is `"some_value"`, use quotation marks or backticks:

[source]
----
myVar.'123 abc !@#'
----

Using quotation marks or backticks to declare an attribute or select a value from an attribute when the attribute name is a valid identifier is optional.

In the previous variable declaration example, attribute `id` is declared without using any quotation marks. To access the value stored in attribute `id`, you can use any of the following methods:

* `myVar.id`
* `myVar.'id'`
* `myVar."id"`
* `myVar.`id``

[[note_top_level_selectors]]
Note that human-readable names, such as `Status Code`, that you see in console output for top-level attributes can differ from the name to use for selecting the attribute, which is `statusCode`. Putting quotes around the human-readable name `Status Code` returns `null` instead of making that top-level attribute selectable. You can find the syntax to use for selecting the top-level attribute names, such as `Status Code`, `Reason Phrase`, and `Headers`, through xref:studio::datasense-concept.adoc#using-datasense-for-autocomplete[autocompletion in Studio] or in the connector documentation, for example, in xref:connectors::http/http-connector-xml-reference.adoc#http-request[HTTP Request] documentation.
