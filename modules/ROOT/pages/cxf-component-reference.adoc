[NOTE]
When sending requests to an external web service, the recommended approach is to use the xref:web-service-consumer.adoc[Web Service Consumer]﻿ rather than the CXF Module.

.Attributes of <jaxws-service...>

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Name |Description
|bindingId |The binding that should be used for this endpoint. It defaults to the SOAP binding by default.

*Type:* string +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* none
|port |The WSDL port name of your service.

*Type:* string +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* none
|namespace |The service namespace. (As of 2.2.1)

*Type:* string +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* none
|service |The WSDL service name of your service.

*Type:* string +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* none
|serviceClass |The class CXF should use to construct its service model. This is optional, and by default uses the implementation class of your component, on inbound CXF endpoint. But it is mandatory for outbound endpoint when using the "aegis" front end.

*Type:* string +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* none
|validationEnabled |Whether or not validation should be enabled on this service. Validation only occurs on inbound server messages.

*Type:* boolean +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* none
|soapVersion |The soapVersion that is going to be used for this endpoint. The specified version is translated into the corresponding bindingId value. This attribute is useful when there's need to avoid the creation of the endpoint with the default binding. In case the bindingId attribute is set this attribute overrides it. If not set and not specified otherwise CXF defaults to SOAP 1.1 binding

*Type:* enumeration +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* none
|mtomEnabled |Whether or not MTOM (attachment support) is enabled for this endpoint.

*Type:* boolean +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* none
|wsdlLocation |The location of the WSDL for your service. If this is a server side endpoint it will served to your users.

*Type:* string +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* none
|enableMuleSoapHeaders |Whether or not this endpoint should write Mule SOAP headers which pass along the correlation and ReplyTo information. This is true by default, but the Mule SOAP headers are only triggered in situations where there is an existing correlation ID and the ReplyTo header is set. (As of 2.2.1)

*Type:* boolean +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* `true`
|configuration-ref |The CXF configuration that should be used.

*Type:* string +
*Required:* no +
*Default:* none
