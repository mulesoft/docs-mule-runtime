*Purpose:* Use a XML-to-Object transformer to transform XML data to a Java Object (also referred to as Java Bean graphs) using XStream.

*Minimum Configuration:* The name of the XStream driver class.

*Discussion:* A XML-to-Object transformer transforms XML data using the specified XStream driver class.

*Important*: Mule uses XStream 1.4.2. The XML-to-object transformer is vulnerable to  http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/64760[CVE-2013-7285]. A remote attacker can send messages to an XML-to-object transformer and can achieve remote code execution (RCE).  For more information, see https://docs.mulesoft.com/release-notes/xml-issues-in-mule-esb[XML Issues in Mule ESB] or contact http://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[MuleSoft Customer Support.]

In addition to the properties common to all transformers, you can also specify class aliases and converters.

Use the General tab to specify or browse to the XStream driver class:

Use the Advanced tab to optionally configure the properties standard to all transformers, plus add or change class aliases and class converters:

Use the Aliases pane to create, edit, or delete aliases for specific classes. Similarly, use the Converters pane to create, edit, or delete class converters.
