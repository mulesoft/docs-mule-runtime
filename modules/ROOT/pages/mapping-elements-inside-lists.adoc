Use Anypoint DataMapper Transformer to map elements within a collection on a message payload.

A http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_(abstract_data_type)[collection] groups data items together in one message payload. Mule can split collections - such as lists or arrays - into individual elements to transform, or otherwise process them. For example, you can use Mule to map the data format of elements in a collection from a Java object to XML. However, rather than use a xref:splitter-flow-control-reference.adoc[*Splitter*], a xref:studio-transformers.adoc[*Transformer*], and an *Aggregator* to map the data, you use one https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/6/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[*DataMapper Transfomer*].

Anypoint DataMapper can map a collection in various ways to produce output data in any of six formats:

* it can map a collection to a "flat" file, such as CSV
* it can map a collection to a collection
* it can map elements in a collection to a flat file, or to elements in another collection
* it can map a *nested collection* (i.e., a collection within a collection) to another nested collection

Before mapping elements in a list, you must first map the list itself to an output object or list. Once the input list maps to the output object or list, you can map its individual child elements.

This document uses two examples to demonstrate how to map elements inside a list:

* xref:mapping-elements-inside-lists.adoc[Mapping Nested Lists to a Flat File (XML to CSV)]
* xref:mapping-elements-inside-lists.adoc[Mapping Nested Lists to a Structured Data File (XML to JSON)]

Both examples require sequential completion of the following high-level tasks.

. Creating the sample input file.
. Creating the sample output file.
. Adding DataMapper to a flow
. Mapping the data

== Mapping Nested List to a Flat File Format (XML to CSV)

To create the sample XML input File:

. Create a new file in a text editor, then paste into it the following contents:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<contact_list type="members" id="id0">
  <contacts>
    <user name="John" lastname="Doe" phone="1111 1111"/>
    <user name="Jane" lastname="Doe" phone="2222 2222"/>
    <user name="Harry" lastname="Hausen" phone="3333 3333"/>
  </contacts>
  <emergency_contacts>
    <user name="Larry" lastname="Larson" phone="4444 4444"/>
    <user name="Harry" lastname="Harrison" phone="5555 5555"/>
    <user name="John" lastname="Johnson" phone="6666 6666"/>
  </emergency_contacts>
</contact_list>
----

. Save the file to a convenient location under a useful, descriptive name, such as `InputList.xml`. This serves as the input XML file for both examples.

To Create the sample CSV output file:

. Create another new text file, then paste into it the following contents:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
Name,Lastname,Phone
----

. Save the file in a convenient location under a useful name, such as `OutputList.csv`. This simple CSV file provides DataMapper with the output data fields. You can modify these fields when configuring the DataMapper building block.

=== Adding Data Mapper to a Flow

The following procedure offers abbreviated steps for adding a DataMapper to a flow. For detailed instructions, consult the https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/6/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[DataMapper Transformer Reference].

. From the *Transformer* group in the *Palette*, drag a *DataMapper* building block to any location in your flow, except to the left of the flow's message source.
. Double-click the DataMapper to open its configuration wizard.
. In the *Name* field, type a useful, descriptive name for your DataMapper, then click *Next*.
. In the *Input* section of the *Select Input and Output Type* pane, use the drop-down menu next to the *Type* field to select *XML*.
. Click *Generate schema from XML*, then use the file browser to select the XML input field you created. Click *OK*.
. In the *Output* section of the *Select Input and Output Type* window, use the drop-down menu next to the *Type* field to select *CSV*.
. In the *Output& section, click the ellipsis (...) next to the *CSV example* field.
. Use the file browser to select the CSV file output file you created.
. Click *Finish* to load the configurations into the *Data Mapping Console*.

The *Input* pane on the left-hand side displays the input XML file's root element, `contact_list`. A dotted line connects `contact_list` to the `csv` root element in the *Output* pane. This dotted line that _for each_ nested element in _contact_list_, you can create an entry in `csv`. In other words, you can map each nested element in `contact_list` to `csv`.

The *Output* pane on the right-hand side displays a list on output elements. The first item is the `csv` output file. In this case, there are no nested lists since the output format is a flat.

=== Mapping the Data

. Click the "closed eye" icon in the *Input* pane to reveal the individual elements in the lists. The two nested list in the XML file, `contacts` and `emergency_contacts`, display their respective child elements.

. Hover your mouse over an *Input Attribute*, identifiable by a blue "e" icon. Mule displays a tooltip specifying which elements in the *Output Pane* you can map the attribute to.

. Click, then drag the `user : userType` element from the input pane to the `csv` root element in the output pane to map the `emergency_contacts` nested list. (Because the CSV output file in this example cannot contain nested lists, you can only drag an input attribute to the root node in the output pane.)

. Click, then drag an individual child element in the `emergency_contacts` list to an individual element in the `csv` output. For example, drag the input elements `name : string` onto the output element `Name : string`.
. Repeat the previous steps to map many input elements to output elements. See the image below for an example.
+

+
Mule maps each *key* in the `emergency_contacts` nested list to its corresponding *value* in the `csv` output mapping. The other nested list in the input XML file - `contacts` - is not mapped. As a result of the `emergency_contacts` mapping, the CSV output includes only the *key-value pairs* for the `emergency_contacts` list (see below).
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
Larry,Larson,4444 4444
Harry,Harrison,5555 5555
John,Johnson,6666 6666
----

== Mapping Nested Lists to Objects (XML to JSON)

In this example, Mule maps data from XML to JSON. The latter supports data structures and associative arrays.

=== Creating the Sample XML Input File

If you haven't already, create a sample XML file.

=== Creating the Sample JSON Output File

. Create a new file in a text editor, then paste into it the following contents:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
{
  "type": "members",
  "id": "id0",
  "contacts": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "lastname": ""
    },
    {
      "name": "",
      "lastname": ""
    },
  ],
  "emergencyContacts": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "lastname": ""
    },
  ]
}
----

. Save the file to a convenient location under a useful descriptive name. This JSON file provides DataMapper with the output data fields.

=== Add DataMapper to a Flow

. Follow steps 1 - 7 of the *Add DataMapper to a Flow* procedure in the previous example. (If you've completed the previous example, the DataMapper wizard asks if you want to overwrite the XML schema file. It is safe to overwrite it; click *OK*.)
. In the *Output* section of the *Select Input and Output Type* window, use the drop-down menu next to the *Type* field to select *JSON*.
. In the *Output* section, click the ellipsis symbol (...) next to the *JSON sample* field.
. Use the file browser to select the JSON file you created.
. Click *Finish* to load the configurations into the *Data Mapping Console*.

=== Mapping the Data

. Click the "closed eye" icon in the *Input* pane or the *Output* pane to display child elements in the XML lists and JSON objects respectively.
+
In the screenshot above, the *Output* mapping pane contains two nested lists: `contacts` and `emergencyContacts`. Mule read the names of these lists from the sample JSON file.
+
Note that the child elements of each list - both in the input pane and in the output pane - are greyed out. Before you can map individual list elements to each other, you must first map the lists (displayed in bold type) themselves.

. Click, the drag the `user : UserType` element in the input pane to the `emergencyContacts` element in the output pane.
+
DataMapper automatically maps all child elements for which it can find a match.
+
Notice that the DataMapper mapped `name` and `lastname`, but not `phone`. This is because the sample JSON file does not contain a child element, or *key*, called `phone`.

. Create a new key for `phone`, then map the input element to the output element.
+
Add a New Key (Field).

// this was a tip, commented out, but the broken images were showing up. kris 7/1/2017 removed broken images, unhide tip text, removed tip formatting

Complete the following steps to create the new key in the output pane.

.. In the output pane, right-click the `emergencyContacts` list, then select *Add Field*.
.. In the *Name* field of the *New Attribute* window, type a name for the attribute.
.. For *Type*, check *Simple*, then use the drop-down menu to select *string*.
.. Click *OK* to create a new `phone` attribute in the JSON output file.
+
.. Click the `phone` element in the input pan, then drag it to the newly-created `phone` key in the output pane.


When mapping inside lists, DataMapper displays the current mapping level in the *Current Element Mapping* drop-down menu between the input and output panes. Use this menu to switch between all levels of mapping. DataMapper automatically adds new levels of mapping as you create them. In this example above, there are two items in the drop-down menu: `contact_list_to_object` and `user_to_emergencyContacts`.

DataMapper automatically created the top level - `contact_list_to_object` - when you completed the configuration in the DataMapper wizard. This level maps the XML input file `<contact_list_type="members" id="id0" >` to the JSON output file:

[source,text,linenums]
----
{
  "type" : "members",
  "id" : "id0",
[...]
----

. Click the `contacts` input attribute, then drag it to the `contacts` output attributes to map the nested `contacts` list.

. DataMapper automatically adds a new mapping to the *Current Element Mapping* drop-down menu; note that it contains: `user_to_contacts`.

. Under the `contacts` element in the output pane, create a new key for `phone`, then map the input element `phone` to this output element.

At this point, you have mapped all of the XML input fields to their corresponding JSON output fields. The top-level mapping `user_to_contacts` is selected, allowing you to see all mappings simultaneously. The arrows for the child mapping levels `contact_list_to_object` and `user_to_emergencyContacts` appear grayed-out.

The output of the mapping should be the following:

[source,text,linenums]
----
{
  "type" : "members",
  "id" : "id0",
  "contacts" : [ {
    "name" : "John",
    "lastname" : "Doe",
    "phone" : "1111 1111"
  }, {
    "name" : "Jane",
    "lastname" : "Doe",
    "phone" : "2222 2222"
  }, {
    "name" : "Harry",
    "lastname" : "Hausen",
    "phone" : "3333 3333"
  } ],
  "emergencyContacts" : [ {
    "name" : "Larry",
    "lastname" : "Larson",
    "phone" : "4444 4444"
  }, {
    "name" : "Harry",
    "lastname" : "Harrison",
    "phone" : "5555 5555"
  }, {
    "name" : "John",
    "lastname" : "Johnson",
    "phone" : "6666 6666"
  } ]
}
