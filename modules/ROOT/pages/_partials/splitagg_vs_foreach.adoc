== Differences between Split Aggregate and For Each Scopes

Both Split Aggregate and For Each split the defined collection, and the
components within the scope process each element in the collection. Also, in
both cases, each route runs with the same initial context. The difference
between these two scopes are:

* For Each works sequentially, while the Split Aggregate processes in parallel.
This difference affects _error handling_:
+
Because of the processing differences, the execution of For Each execution is
interrupted when an error is raised (and the Error Handler is invoked), while
Split Aggregate processes every route before invoking the Error Handler with a
`MULE:COMPOSITE_ROUTE` error type.
+
* For Each does not modify the payload, while the Split Aggregate outputs a
collection of the output messages from each iteration.
