//tag::transactionIdIntro[]
The Set Transaction Id component enables you to set an identifier for all tracked events so that meaningful information, such as an order number, is displayed for a transaction when analyzing tracked events at runtime, whether using Anypoint Runtime Manager or CloudHub.

The transaction ID supports DataWeave expressions, which enables you to create an ID dynamically and include information related to the event into the ID.
