The scripting module provides facilities for using scripting languages in Mule. Any scripting languages that support http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[JSR-223] can be used inside Mule. Scripts can be used as implementations of components or transformers. Also, scripts can be used for expression evaluations, meaning message routing can be controlled using script evaluations on the current message. You can even configure Mule instances from scripts.

== Component

Defines a script component backed by a JSR-223 compliant script engine such as Groovy, JavaScript, or Ruby. Scripting allows you to either directly embed your script inside the XML config or reference a script using Spring's dynamic language support: http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/dynamic-language.html.

|script |0..1 |A script to be executed by a JSR-223 compliant script engine such as Groovy, JavaScript(Rhino), Python, Ruby, or Beanshell.
|java-interface-binding |0..* |A binding associates a Mule endpoint with an injected Java interface (this is like using Spring to inject a bean, but instead of calling a method on the bean a message is sent to an endpoint). Script bindings will only work with Java-based scripting languages. Right now there is no validation on when languages support Java bindings because there are so many scripting languages.

The following example demonstrates how to configure a Groovy script component with an in-line script:

== Script Context Bindings

When run inside Mule, scripts have a number of objects available to them in the script context:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|`log` |A logger that can be used to write to Mule's log file.
|`muleContext` |A reference to the MuleContext object.
|`registry` |A convenience shortcut to Mule registry (otherwise available via `muleContext.registry`).
|`eventContext` |A reference to the event context. This allows you to dispatch events progammatically from your script.
|`message` |The current message.
|`originalPayload` |The payload of the current message before any transforms.
|`payload` |The transformed payload of the current message if a transformer is configured on the flow. Otherwise this is the same value as `originalPayload`.
|`src` |Same as `payload`, kept for backward compatibility.
|flowConstruct |A reference to the current flow object.
|`id` |The current message ID.
|`result` a|
A placeholder object where the result of the script can be written. Usually it's better to just return a value from the script unless the script method doesn't have a return value.

[WARNING]
If your script needs to return null, you must set result=null instead of simply returning null

|message properties |Any message properties can be used as variables for the script.

|message |the current message.
|originalPayload |the payload of the current message before any transforms.
|payload |the transformed payload of the current message if a transformer is configured on the service. Otherwise this is the same value as _originalPayload_.
|src |same as _payload_, kept for backward compatibility.
|service |a reference to the current service object.
|id |the current event id.
|result |a placeholder object where the result of the script can be written to. Usually it's better to just return a value from the script unless the script method doesn't have a return value.

=== Transformers

These are transformers specific to this transport. Note that these are added automatically to the Mule registry at start up. When doing automatic transformations these will be included when searching for the correct transformers.

[%header%autowidth.spread]

|Name |Description
|transformer |Runs a script to perform transformation on the current message.

=== Filters

Filters can be used to control which data is allowed to continue in the flow.

== Script Configuration Builder

The https://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/current/apidocs/org/mule/module/scripting/builders/ScriptConfigurationBuilder.html[ScriptConfigurationBuilder] allows developers to create a Mule instance from a JSR-223 compliant script. To load the manager from Groovy:

----
                ConfigurationBuilder builder = new ScriptConfigurationBuilder("groovy", "../conf/mule-config.groovy");                MuleContext muleContext = new DefaultMuleContextFactory().createMuleContext(builder);
----

Or to start the server from the command line:

----
mule -M-Dorg.mule.script.engine=groovy
                -builder org.mule.module.scripting.builders.ScriptConfigurationBuilder
                -config ../conf/mule-config.groovy
----

For more information about configuring a Mule instance from code or script see [Configuration Overview].

To use Groovy as an example, the following transformer configuration converts a comma-separated string of values to a `java.util.List:`

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<script:transformer name="stringReplaceWithParams">
        <script:script engine="groovy">
            <property key="oldStr" value="l"/>
            <property key="newStr" value="x"/>
            <script:text>
                return payload.toString().replaceAll("$oldStr", "$newStr")
            </script:text>
        </script:script>
    </script:transformer>
