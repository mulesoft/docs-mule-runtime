The scripting module provides facilities for using scripting languages in Mule. Any scripting languages that support http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[JSR-223] can be used inside Mule. Scripts can be used as implementations of components or transformers. Also, scripts can be used for expression evaluations, meaning message routing can be controlled using script evaluations on the current message. You can even configure Mule instances from scripts.

== Component

Defines a script component backed by a JSR-223 compliant script engine such as Groovy, JavaScript, or Ruby. Scripting allows you to either directly embed your script inside the XML config or reference a script using Spring's dynamic language support: http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/dynamic-language.html.

.Attributes of <component...>
[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|script-ref |string |no |  |A reference to a script object bean, that is, a `<script:script ...>` definition.
|===

.Child Elements of <component...>
[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|script |0..1 |A script to be executed by a JSR-223 compliant script engine such as Groovy, JavaScript(Rhino), Python, Ruby, or Beanshell.
|java-interface-binding |0..* |A binding associates a Mule endpoint with an injected Java interface (this is like using Spring to inject a bean, but instead of calling a method on the bean a message is sent to an endpoint). Script bindings will only work with Java-based scripting languages. Right now there is no validation on when languages support Java bindings because there are so many scripting languages.
|===

== Configuring an In-line Script

The following example demonstrates how to configure a Groovy script component with an in-line script:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:script="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/scripting"
      xmlns:vm="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/vm"
      xsi:schemaLocation="
       http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
       http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/scripting
       http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/scripting/current/mule-scripting.xsd
       http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/vm http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/vm/current/mule-vm.xsd">

    <vm:connector name="vmConnector"/>

    <script:script name="myScript" engine="groovy">
        return "$payload Received"
    </script:script>

        <flow name="inlineScript">
            <vm:inbound-endpoint path="vm:in1"/>
            <script:component>
                <script:script engine="groovy">
                    return "$payload Received"
                </script:script>
            </script:component>
            <vm:outbound-endpoint path="out1"/>
        </flow>
...
----

== Message Flows Using Bindings

The following example demonstrates how to orchestrate message flows using bindings. The example calls out to two different flows and passes the results on to the outbound router:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="scriptWithBindings">
            <inbound>
                <inbound-endpoint ref="client_request"/>
            </inbound>
            <script:component>
                <script:script engine="groovy">
                    msg = CalloutService.doSomething(payload)
                    return CalloutService.doSomethingElse(msg)
                </script:script>
                <script:java-interface-binding interface="org.mule.components.script.CalloutService" method="doSomething">
                    <outbound-endpoint ref="callout_1" synchronous="true"/>
                </script:java-interface-binding>
                <script:java-interface-binding interface="org.mule.components.script.CalloutService" method="doSomethingElse">
                    <outbound-endpoint ref="callout_2" synchronous="true"/>
                </script:java-interface-binding>
            </script:component>
            <outbound>
                <pass-through-router>
                    <outbound-endpoint ref="client_response"/>
                </pass-through-router>
            </outbound>
        </flow>

        <flow name="Callout1">
            <inbound>
                <inbound-endpoint ref="callout_1"/>
            </inbound>
            <test:component appendString=" Received by #[mule:context.serviceName]"/>
        </flow>

        <flow name="Callout2">
            <inbound>
                <inbound-endpoint ref="callout_2"/>
            </inbound>
            <test:component appendString=" Received by #[mule:context.serviceName]"/>
        </flow>

=== Script Context Bindings

When run inside Mule, scripts have a number of objects available to them in the script context. These are:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Name |Description
|log |a logger that can be used to write to Mule's log file.
|muleContext |a reference to the MuleContext object.
|eventContext |A reference to the eventcontext. This allows you to dispatch events progammatically from your script
|message |the current message.
|originalPayload |the payload of the current message before any transforms.
|payload |the transformed payload of the current message if a transformer is configured on the service. Otherwise this is the same value as _originalPayload_.
|src |same as _payload_, kept for backward compatibility.
|service |a reference to the current service object.
|id |the current event id.
|result |a placeholder object where the result of the script can be written to. Usually it's better to just return a value from the script unless the script method doesn't have a return value.
|===

=== Transformer

Runs a script to perform transformation on the current message.

=== Script

Represents a script that can be used as a component for a service or a transformer. The script text can be pulled in from a script file or can be embedded inside this element. A script can be executed by any JSR-223 compliant script engine such as Groovy, JavaScript(Rhino), Python, Ruby, or Beanshell.

.Attributes of <script...>
[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |string |no |  |The name used to identify this script object. This is used when you want to reference this script object from a component or transformer.
|engine |string |no |  |The name of the script engine being used. All scripting languages that support JSR-223 have a script engine name such as groovy, ruby, python, etc. If this value is not set, but a script file is configured, Mule will attempt to load the correct script engine according to the script file's extension.
|file |string |no |  |The script file to load for this object. The file can be on the classpath or local file system.
|===

.Child Elements of <script...>
[%header,cols="34,33,33"]

=== Script Configuration Builder (Deprecated, will be removed as of Mule 4.0)

The https://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/3.6.0/apidocs/org/mule/module/scripting/builders/ScriptConfigurationBuilder.html[ScriptConfigurationBuilder] allows developers to create a Mule instance from a JSR-223 compliant script. To load the manager from Groovy:

[source,java,linenums]
----
ConfigurationBuilder builder = new ScriptConfigurationBuilder("groovy", "../conf/mule-config.groovy");
                MuleContext muleContext = new DefaultMuleContextFactory().createMuleContext(builder);
----

Or to start the server from the command line:

[source,text,linenums]
----
mule -M-Dorg.mule.script.engine=groovy
-builder org.mule.module.scripting.builders.ScriptConfigurationBuilder
-config ../conf/mule-config.groovy
----

For more information about configuring a Mule instance from code or script see [Configuration Overview].

=== Script Context Bindings

When run inside Mule, scripts have a number of objects available to them in the script context:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Name |Description
|`id` |The current message ID.
|`log` |A logger that can be used to write to Mule's log file.
|`message` |The current message.
|`muleContext` |A reference to the MuleContext object.
|`originalPayload` |The payload of the current message before any transforms.
|`payload` |The transformed payload of the current message if a transformer is configured on the flow. Otherwise this is the same value as `originalPayload`.
|`result` a|
A placeholder object where the result of the script can be written. Usually it's better to just return a value from the script unless the script method doesn't have a return value.

[WARNING]
If your script needs to return null, you must set result=null instead of simply returning null.

|`service` |A reference to the current service.
|message properties |Any message properties can be used as variables for the script.
|===

=== Script Configuration Builder

 *Note*: Deprecated and will be removed in Mule 4.0.

The https://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/3.6.0/apidocs/org/mule/module/scripting/builders/ScriptConfigurationBuilder.html[ScriptConfigurationBuilder] lets you create a Mule instance from a JSR-223 compliant script.

To load the manager from Groovy:

[source,java,linenums]
----
ConfigurationBuilder builder = new ScriptConfigurationBuilder("groovy", "../conf/mule-config.groovy");
MuleContext muleContext = new DefaultMuleContextFactory().createMuleContext(builder);
----

Or to start the server from the command line:

[source,text,linenums]
----
mule -M-Dorg.mule.script.engine=groovy -builder org.mule.module.scripting.builders.ScriptConfigurationBuilder -config ../conf/mule-config.groovy
----

==== Transformer

Runs a script to perform transformation on the current message.

.Attributes of <transformer...>
[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description

.Child Elements of <transformer...>
[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|script |0..1 |A script to be executed by a JSR-223 compliant script engine such as Groovy, JavaScript(Rhino), Python, Ruby, or Beanshell.
|===

To use Groovy as an example, the following transformer configuration converts a comma-separated string of values to a `java.util.List`.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<script:transformer name="stringReplaceWithParams">
        <script:script engine="groovy">
            <property key="oldStr" value="l"/>
            <property key="newStr" value="x"/>
            <script:text>
                return payload.toString().replaceAll("$oldStr", "$newStr")
            </script:text>
        </script:script>
    </script:transformer>
