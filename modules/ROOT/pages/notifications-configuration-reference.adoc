This page provides details on the elements you configure for notifications. Some of this information is pulled directly from `mule.xsd` and is cached. If the information appears to be out of date, refresh the page. For more information on notifications, see xref:mule-server-notifications.adoc[Mule Server Notifications].

== Notifications

Registers listeners for notifications and associates interfaces with particular events.

=== Attributes of <notifications...>

[%header,cols="10,10,10,10,60"]

|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|dynamic |boolean |no |  |If the notification manager is dynamic, listeners can be registered dynamically at runtime via the MuleContext, and the configured notification can be changed. Otherwise, some parts of Mule will cache notification configuration for efficiency and will not generate events for newly enabled notifications or listeners. The default value is false.

|Name |Cardinality |Description
|notification |0..* |Associates an event with an interface. Listeners that implement the interface will receive instances of the event.
|disable-notification |0..* |Blocks the association of an event with a particular interface. This filters events after the association with a particular interface (and so takes precedence).
|notification-listener |0..* |Registers a bean as a listener with the notification system. Events are dispatched by reflection - the listener will receive all events associated with any interfaces it implements. The relationship between interfaces and events is configured by the notification and disable-notification elements.

|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|event-class |class name |no |  |The class associated with a notification event that will be delivered to the interface. This can be used instead of the 'event' attribute to specify a custom class.
|event |notificationTypes |no |  |The notification event to deliver.
|interface-class |class name |no |  |The interface (class name) that will receive the notification event.

== Disable notification

Blocks the association of an event with a particular interface. This filters events after the association with a particular interface (and so takes precedence).

=== Attributes of <disable-notification...>

[%header,cols="10,10,10,10,60"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|event-class |class name |no |  |The class associated with an event that will no longer be delivered to any interface. This can be used instead of the 'event' attribute to specify a custom class.
|event |notificationTypes |no |  |The event you no longer want to deliver.
|interface-class |class name |no |  |The interface (class name) that will no longer receive the event.
|interface |notificationTypes |no |  |The interface that will no longer receive the event.

== Notification listener

Registers a bean as a listener with the notification system. Events are dispatched by reflection - the listener will receive all events associated with any interfaces it implements. The relationship between interfaces and events is configured by the notification and disable-notification elements.

== Notification Types

You can specify the following types of notifications using the `event` attribute of the `<notification>` and `<disable-notification>` element:

* COMPONENT-MESSAGE
* CONNECTION
* CONTEXT
* CUSTOM
* ENDPOINT-MESSAGE
* EXCEPTION
* MANAGEMENT
* MODEL
* REGISTRY
* ROUTING
* SECURITY
* SERVICE
* TRANSACTION
