This page provides details on the elements to configure for notifications. If the information appears to be out of date, refresh the page.
//For more information on notifications, see xref:mule-server-notifications.adoc[Mule Server Notifications].

== Notifications

Registers listeners for notifications and associates interfaces with particular events.

=== Attributes of Notifications

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|`dynamic` |If the notification manager is dynamic, listeners can be registered dynamically at runtime through the MuleContext, and the configured notification can be changed. Otherwise, some parts of Mule cache notification configurations for efficiency and do not generate events for newly-enabled notifications or listeners. +
*Type*: `boolean` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `false`
|===

=== Child Elements of Notifications

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|`notification` |0..* |Associates an event with an interface. Listeners that implement the interface receive instances of the event.
|`disable-notification` |0..* |Blocks the association of an event with a particular interface. This filters events after the association with a particular interface (and so takes precedence).
|`notification-listener` |0..* |Registers a bean as a listener with the notification system. Events are dispatched by reflection. The listener receives all events associated with the interfaces it implements. The relationship between interfaces and events is configured by the notification and disable-notification elements.
|===

== Notification

=== Attributes of Notification

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|`event-class` |The class associated with a notification event to deliver to the interface. You can use this instead of the `event` attribute to specify a custom class. +
*Type*: `class name` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`event` |The notification event to deliver. +
*Type*: `notificationTypes` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`interface-class` |The class name of the interface that receives the notification event. +
*Type*: `class name` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`interface` |The name of the interface that receives the notification event. +
*Type*: `notificationTypes` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|===

No child elements for `notification`.

== Disable Notification

Blocks the association of an event with a particular interface. This filters events after the association with a particular interface (and so takes precedence).

=== Attributes of disable-notification

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|`event-class` |The class associated with an event that is no longer delivered to any interface. You can use this instead of the  attribute to specify a custom class. +
*Type*: `class name` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`event` |The event you no longer want to deliver. +
*Type*: `notificationTypes` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`interface-class` |The interface (class name) that no longer receives the event. +
*Type*: `class name` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`interface` |The interface that no longer receives the event. +
*Type*: `notificationTypes` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|===

No child elements for `disable-notification`.

== Notification Listener

Registers a bean as a listener with the notification system. Events are dispatched by reflection. The listener
receives all events associated with any interface it implements. Use the `<notification>` and `<disable-notification>` elements to configure the relationship between interfaces and events.

== Notification Types

You can specify the following types of notifications using the `event` attribute of the `<notification>` and `<disable-notification>` element:

* ASYNC-MESSAGE
* COMPONENT-MESSAGE
* CONNECTION
* CONTEXT
* CUSTOM
* ENDPOINT-MESSAGE
* EXCEPTION
* EXCEPTION-STRATEGY
* MANAGEMENT
* MESSAGE-PROCESSOR
* MODEL
* PIPELINE-MESSAGE
* REGISTRY
* ROUTING
* SECURITY
* SERVICE
* TRANSACTION
