= Math (dw::util::Math)

A utility module that provides mathematical functions.


_Introduced in DataWeave 2.4.0. Supported by Mule 4.4.0 and later._

To use this module, you must import it to your DataWeave code, for example,
by adding the line `import * from dw::util::Math` to the header of your
DataWeave script.
