|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|expandEmptyElements |boolean |no |  |Whether to expand empty elements from <tagName> to <tagName></tagName>.
|indentEnabled |boolean |no |  |Whether to enable indenting of the XML code. If true, the indent string and size are used.
|indentString |string |no |  |The string to use as the indent, usually an empty space.
|indentSize |integer |no |  |The number of indent strings to use for each indent, such as "2" if `indentString` is set to an empty space and you want to use two empty spaces for each indent.
|lineSeparator |string |no |  |The string to use for new lines, typically "\n".
|newLineAfterNTags |integer |no |  |If the `newlines` attribute is true, the number of closing tags after which a newline separator is inserted. For example, setting this to "5" will cause a newline to be inserted after the output of five closing tags (including single tags).
|newlines |boolean |no |  |Whether newlines should be printed. If false, the XML is printed all on one line.
|newLineAfterDeclaration |boolean |no |  |Whether a new line is printed after the XML declaration (assuming it is not suppressed).
|omitEncoding |boolean |no |  |Whether the XML declaration line includes the encoding of the document. It is common to suppress this in protocols such as SOAP.
|padText |boolean |no |  |Whether to ensure that text immediately preceded by or followed by an element will be "padded" with a single space. This is useful when you set `trimText` to true and want to ensure that "the quick <b>brown</b> fox" does not become "the quick<b>brown</b>fox".
|suppressDeclaration |boolean |no |  |Whether to suppress the XML declaration line. It is common to suppress this in protocols such as SOAP.
|trimText |boolean |no |  |Whether to trim white space in the XML.
|XHTML |boolean |no |  |Whether to use the XHTML standard, which is like HTML but passes an XML parser with real closed tags, and outputs CDATA sections with CDATA delimiters.
