= Splitter Flow Control Reference
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

The Splitter Flow Control splits a message into separate fragments, then sends these fragments one at a time to the next message processor in the flow. Segments are identified based on an expression parameter, usually written in xref:3.7@mule-expression-language-mel.adoc[Mule Expression Language (MEL)], but other formats can be employed also. You can then use a *Collection Aggregator* Flow Control to reassemble the parts of the original message. You can also include a *Resequencer* Flow Control to put the parts back into the original sequence in case they are shuffled out of order.

Splitting and aggregating the message is especially useful when you intend to process the split parts in asynchronous flows running on separate servers. Together, the splitter and aggregator flow controls allow you to share the workload among several servers and still be able to reassemble the message after it's processed.

=== Basic Splitter Example

In this simple example, Mule splits an XML payload it into several items.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== STUDIO Visual Editor

. Create a new Anypoint Studio project and drag an HTTP connector onto an empty canvas.
. Create a new Conector Configuration element for it by clicking the green plus sign next to the Connector Configuration field. Set `localhost` as the *host* and leave the default value `8081` as the *port*.
. Drag a *Splitter Flow Control* into the flow, to receive messages from the HTTP connector.
. Configure the Splitter as shown. In the *Expression* parameter, provide the http://www.freeformatter.com/xpath-tester.html#ad-output[XPath] expression `//actor`, wrapped inside a MEL expression. This XPath expression selects every XML element named 'actor'. The splitter will make each of these (together with its children) into a new message.

== Aggregating the Payload

When the splitter splits a message, it adds three new *outbound variables* into each of the output fragments. These three variables are later used by the *Aggregator* to reassemble the message:

** *MULE_CORRELATION_GROUP_SIZE*: number of fragments into which the original message was split +
** *MULE_CORRELATION_SEQUENCE*: position of a fragment within the group
** *MULE_CORRELATION_ID*: single ID for entire group (all output fragments of the same original message share the same value)

image::variables-diagramv2.png[variables+diagramv2]

You can look at the values of these outbound variables by putting a break point after the splitter and running your flow with the xref:5@studio::studio-visual-debugger.adoc[Visual Debugger]:

image::variables.png[]

Thanks to these variables, when an aggregator receives a single fragment, it knows what group to put it into and how large this group should be. Once all of the fragments have arrived, it passes on the complete group as a single message.

=== Example Splitting and Aggregating with Asynchronous Flows

This example builds upon the basic example above. Follow the steps below to run message fragments in asynchronous flows and then aggregate them back into a single message.

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Drag a *VM connector* to the end of the flow.
+
image::splitter-flow-2.png[splitter+flow+2]

. Drag a second VM connector outside the existing flow, below it. This creates a new flow.

. Drag the existing logger you had in the first flow to the new second flow, after the VM connector.
+
image::splitter-flow-3.png[splitter+flow+3]

. Configure the two VM connectors. Change both their *Queue Path* to `step2`.
+
image::vm4.png[]
+
Once both VMs have the same *Queue Path* configured, they will be linked. Messages that arrive to the first VM will continue their path out of the second VM. +
What you have at this point appears to work identically to what you built in the first example. There is, however, one key difference: each fraction of the message will be processed simultaneously rather than in sequence. If you deploy your app to a cluster of servers this will have a big effect on performance.

. Add a Collection aggregator in the second flow, after the Logger.

. Add one more logger after the Collection aggregator, to see how the final message is output.
+
image::splitter-flow-4.png[splitter+flow+4]

. Run the Mule project.

. You must now send the HTTP connector an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached XML file. +
Send a Post request to http://localhost:8081/ attaching XML to the body of the message. Sample XML is provided below.
+
[TIP]
The easiest way to do this is sending posts via a browser extension such as Postman (for Google Chrome) or the http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] command line utility.

You should see four messages logged into the console: the first three should be short, one for every "actor" XML element (notice the ID attribute in each message). After these first three messages there should be a fourth, longer message, which is logged after the aggregator has run. Notice two things:

* Although the aggregator was triggered three times, once for every fraction of the message that reached it, it produced one single output message, only when all of the fractions were in place
* The aggregator assembles the message in the order in which fractions have arrived; the final message may be shuffled. If maintaining the original sequence is important to you, take a look at the Advanced Example 2 in this page

=== Example Reordering Before Aggregating

This example builds upon the previous example.

If fractions of the message are being processed in parallel in different servers, there's a good chance that they may take different lengths of time to be processed, and consequently fall out of order. The following example solves that problem.

Follow the steps below to:

* run message fragments in asynchronous flows
* arrange them back into the original sequence
* aggregate them back into a single message that follows the original sequence

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Add a *Resequencer* Flow Control before the aggregator
+
image::splitter-flow-5.png[splitter+flow+5]
+
The Resequencer will wait for all of the messages in the group to arrive (keeping track of MULE_CORRELATION_ID and MULE_CORRELATION_GROUP_SIZE ) and then reorder them according to their MULE_CORRELATION_SEQUENCE index.
+
The Resequencer outputs three distinct messages, so the Aggregator is still needed to merge them into one.
. Run the Mule project.
. You must now send the HTTP connector an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached XML file. Send a Post request to http://localhost:8081/ attaching XML to the body of the message. Sample XML is provided below.
+
[TIP]
The easiest way to do this is sending posts via a browser extension such as Postman (for Google Chrome), or the http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] command-line utility.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<root xmlns:foo="http://www.foo.org/" xmlns:bar="http://www.bar.org">
    <actors>
        <actor id="1">Christian Bale</actor>
        <actor id="2">Liam Neeson</actor>
        <actor id="3">Will Ferrell</actor>
    </actors>
    <foo:singers>
        <foo:singer id="4">Dave Grohl</foo:singer>

        <foo:singer id="6">Weird Al</foo:singer>
    </foo:singers>
</root>
----

With the Resequencer in place, messages now reach the aggregator in the correct order and are assembled accordingly.

[NOTE]
====
*Try out this demonstration*
The following is not an implementable solution but rather a proof of concept that highlights what occurs in the flow.

To really take advantage of splitting the message, you should deploy your app to a cluster of servers. By following the steps below, you can simulate the random delays of a cluster of servers.


. Add a *Groovy component* in the second flow, between the VM and the logger.
+
image::splitter-flow-6.png[splitter+flow+6]
+

. Copy the following code into the Groovy Component:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
random = new Random()
randomInt = random.nextInt(10)*1000
Thread.sleep(randomInt)
return payload
----
+
This snippet of code simply introduces a random delay of up to 10 seconds. As each message is running asynchronously, this delay can potentially alter the order in which messages move on to the next step, simulating what could happen in a real implementation with parallel servers processing each fraction of the message.
. Run the project.
. You must now send the HTTP connector an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached XML file. +
Send a Post request to http://localhost:8081/ attaching XML to the body of the message. Sample XML is provided below.
+
[TIP]
The easiest way to do this is sending posts via a browser extension such as Postman (for Google Chrome), or the http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] command-line utility.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<root xmlns:foo="http://www.foo.org/" xmlns:bar="http://www.bar.org">
    <actors>
        <actor id="1">Christian Bale</actor>
        <actor id="2">Liam Neeson</actor>
        <actor id="3">Will Ferrell</actor>
    </actors>
    <foo:singers>
        <foo:singer id="4">Dave Grohl</foo:singer>
        <foo:singer id="5">B.B. King</foo:singer>
        <foo:singer id="6">Weird Al</foo:singer>
    </foo:singers>
</root>
----

You should now see three messages logged into the console, one for every "actor" XML element. These will likely not have their MULE_CORRELATION_SEQUENCE indexes in order due to the random delays caused by the Groovy code.

Below these, you will see a fourth longer message where these indexes are put back in order by the Resequencer.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor

. Add a *Resequencer* Flow Control before the aggregator.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<resequencer failOnTimeout="true" doc:name="Resequencer"/>
----
+
[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Attribute |Value
a|`failOnTimeout` a|`true`
a|`doc:name` a|`Resequencer`

|===
+
The Resequencer will wait for all of the messages in the group to arrive (keeping track of MULE_CORRELATION_ID and MULE_CORRELATION_GROUP_SIZE ) and then reorder them according to their MULE_CORRELATION_SEQUENCE index. +
The Resequencer will output three distinct messages, so the Aggregator is still needed to merge them into one.
. Run the Mule project.
. You must now send the HTTP connector an HTTP request that includes a body with an attached XML file. Send a Post request to http://localhost:8081/ attaching XML to the body of the message. Sample XML is provided below.

        <foo:singer id="6">Weird Al</foo:singer>
    </foo:singers>
</root>
----

With the Resequencer in place, messages now reach the aggregator in the correct order and are assembled accordingly.
