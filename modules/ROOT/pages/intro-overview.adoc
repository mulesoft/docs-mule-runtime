Mule runtime engine (Mule) 4 simplifies the expression language and reduces management complexity so that you can speed up the on-ramping process and deliver applications faster than in Mule 3.

Conceptually, you can think of Mule 4 as an evolution of Mule 3. Many of the core concepts are the same: applications, flows, connectors, DataWeave, and so on. However, because it is simpler, there is less to learn and less for you to manage.

This overview takes you through the high-level changes in Mule 4 so that you can quickly learn the basics. It covers these topics:

* xref:intro-mule-message.adoc[Mule Message] - the Mule Message structure has evolved to make it easier to work with properties and to provide more consistency across connectors.
* xref:intro-expressions.adoc[Expression language] - the Mule Expression Language has been replaced with the DataWeave language so that you work with data and learn Mule more easily.
* xref:intro-connectors.adoc[Connectors] - the approach to connectivity was unified in Mule 4. Mule 3 transports were replaced with new operation-oriented connectors that are easier to use, have better out-of-the-box defaults, and provide new advanced capabilities.
* xref:intro-error-handlers.adoc[Error Handling] - easier and more powerful error handling with a new Try scope.
* xref:intro-dataweave2.adoc[DataWeave] - DataWeave includes minor changes to simplify the syntax and make it easier to learn.
* xref:intro-studio.adoc[Studio 7] - features a simplified palette, improved Maven integration, and many other usability improvements.
* xref:intro-engine.adoc[Runtime engine] - the internal execution engine has been updated with a new self-tuning and non-blocking reactive engine. This allows for better performance and scalability out-of-the-box.
