Mule apps process messages and other parts of Mule events through Mule
components, connectors, and modules that are set up within the scope of
Flow and Subflow components within an app.

An app can consist of a single flow, or it can break up processing into
discrete flows and subflows that you add to the app and connect together. Mule
apps in production environments typically use multiple flows and subflows
to divide the app into functional modules or for
<<error_handling, error-handling>> purposes. For example, one flow might
receive a record and transform data into a given format that another
flow processes in some special way.

You can connect and trigger their execution with xref:flowref-about.adoc[Flow Reference]
components or by using the DataWeave `lookup` function within expressions and
transformations. The function passes the current event to another flow for
further event processing. In this way, you can think of a flow or subflow
as a function call that accepts an event as input and then returns the
modified event.

== Using Flows

Flows can have xref:sources-reference.adoc[Mule Sources] (such as an HTTP listener receiving a request)
that trigger the execution of a flow. For cases where you do not want
a source to start a flow right away, you can configure your flow as
initially stopped and start it later through
xref:runtime-manager::flow-management.adoc[Runtime Manager].

You typically use Flow Ref component or `lookup` function only for
triggering flows that lack a source.

Like functions or methods in other programming languages, it is a best practice
to focus your flows on specific (perhaps reusable) activities, such as receiving
an API request from a web client, processing the event, then returning an
appropriate response. If the event processing gets complicated, or must call
out to other services, you might factor out that behavior into other flows.

== Using Subflows

You can also group a series of event processors into subflows. Like a flow, a
subflow is a scope that groups together a sequence of event processors, but it
does not have an event source, and it does not have its own error handling.
Subflows are always called from another flow or subflow through a Flow Ref
component or from a DataWeave `lookup` call.

== Error Handling

Each flow (but not subflow) can have its own error handling. One reason for
calling a flow through a Flow Ref component is to separate out the error
handling to different contexts. For example, a parent flow that receives web
client requests might define HTTP-related error handling. If the parent flow
then calls a JMS queue for further processing, you can put the JMS event
processors in a separate child flow and call that flow with a Flow Ref
component. This child flow can then define its own JMS-related error handling.
This practice is similar to the way you handle or propagate errors in other
programming languages, like Java.

Like a flow or subflow, a xref:try-scope-concept.adoc[Try scope] also groups
together a sequence of event processors with its own error handling. You can
place a Try scope inside a flow or subflow to isolate error handling inside a
flow without the need to create a separate flow or subflow. The trade-off
is that error handling through a Try scope occurs inline inside the flow,
which makes it harder to reuse between other flows or subflows.

In both cases, calling a flow or including a Try scope isolates the error
handling, similar to the use of Try-Catch blocks inside Java code. For
example, placing JMS queue event processing (described above) in its own
flow or within a Try scope results in exactly the same error handling
behavior, but the event processors in a Try scope cannot be called from
another flow.

== Branching Event Processing

Some scopes are available for a flow to branch event processing into separate
threads and to allow asynchronous processing of the event at a specific point
in the flow, for example, the xref:scatter-gather-concept.adoc[Scatter-Gather] and
xref:async-scope-reference.adoc[Async] scopes. A xref:choice-router-concept.adoc[Choice]
router enables you to change the downstream sequence of event processors based
on some condition.
