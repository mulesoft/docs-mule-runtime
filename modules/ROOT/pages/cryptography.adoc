This module provides cryptography capabilities to a Mule application. Its main features include:

* Symmetric encryption and decryption of messages.
* Asymmetric encryption and decryption of messages.
* Message signing and signature validation of signed messages.

Three different strategies are supported when using the module:

* PGP: Signature/encryption using PGP.
* XML: For signing or encrypting XML documents or elements.
* JCE: For using a wider range of cryptography capabilities as provided by the Java Cryptography Extension.
