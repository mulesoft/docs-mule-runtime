When presented with nested structures of data, you might need to reduce (or
"flatten") the data in them to produce a simpler output.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]

This DataWeave example
flattens the data in the `interests` and `contenttypes` arrays with the function
that is defined in the header, and it only outputs `contenttypes` when it is not
empty.

The example uses these functions:

* `map` to go through a set elements in the input.
* `reduce` to flatten the arrays.
* `if` to conditionally display a field.
* `splitBy` to parse the input.
