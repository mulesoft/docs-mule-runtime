= Core Components

Like the operations in connectors and modules, Core components are important
building blocks of flows in a Mule app. Core components provide the logic
for processing a Mule event as it travels in a series of linked steps through
the app. Examples include the Scheduler, For Each, and Logger components.

In Studio, Mule components are accessible by clicking *Core* from the Mule palette.

Notice that the components are subdivided into types, including Batch,
Error Handling, and Flow Control.

== Batch

To process Mule messages in batches, instead of processing them all together,
you can use Batch components, which include:

* Batch Aggregator
* Batch Job
* Batch Step

See xref:batch-processing-concept.adoc[Batch Processors].

== Components

These Core components perform a variety of tasks:

* xref:business-events-custom.adoc[Custom Business Events]: For collecting information
about flows and message processors that handle your business transactions. See also
xref:business-events.adoc[Business Events].
* xref:dynamic-evaluate-component-reference.adoc[Dynamic Evaluate]: For dynamically
selecting a script, instead of forcing you to hardcode it through the Transform Message Component.
* xref:flowref-about.adoc[Flow Reference]: For routing the Mule event to another
flow or subflow (and back) within a Mule app.
* xref:logger-component-reference.adoc[Logger]: For logging important information about
your Mule app, such as error messages and status notifications.
* xref:parse-template-reference.adoc[Parse Template]: For processing a template
and obtaining a result.
* xref:transform-component-about.adoc[Transform Message]: For converting input
data to a new output structure or format.

== Endpoints

Endpoints (sometimes called Sources in Studio) include 
components that initiate (or trigger) processing in a Mule flow. The 
xref:scheduler-concept.adoc[Scheduler] is an endpoint. It triggers a flow to start 
at a configurable interval.

Note that some connectors provide listeners that serve as endpoints. Listeners
can trigger a flow when they receive an external request. For example, an HTTP
Listener that is configured for a given URL can trigger a flow when someone or
some process goes to that URL.

== Error Handling

Error handling components route and process Mule errors that occur in a Mule app:

* Error Handler
* On Error Continue
* On Error Propagate

See xref:error-handling.adoc[Error Handlers]

== Flow Control (Routers)

A Flow Control component (or Router) takes the input Mule event and routes it to
one or more separate sequences of components. Flow Control components include:

* Choice
* First Successful
* Round Robin
* Scatter-Gather

For example, a xref:choice-router-concept.adoc[Choice router] applies
DataWeave logic to pick one of two or more routes, where each route is a separate
sequence of event processors.

A xref:scatter-gather-concept.adoc[Scatter-Gather router] router sends the
input event to every route, and each route independently processes the event.
After every route has processed the event, the results from all the routes are
combined together into one output event.

== Scopes

A Scope is a type of component that groups together a sequence of event processors
(such as other Core components and operations from both modules and connectors)
to apply some programming behavior to that isolated sequence of event processors.

Scopes include these components:

* Async
* Cache
* Flow
* For Each
* Try
* Until Successful

For example, a Try scope lets you isolate and handle any errors that occur in
a particular sequence of flows. So, you might wrap an outbound HTTP Request
connector (and perhaps some other surrounding components before and after
the HTTP Request connector, such as a Transform Message component or a
Logging component) in a Try scope, so if an error results, you can apply
logging or compensation logic specific to that grouping of components. See
xref:try-scope-concept.adoc[Try Scope].

Another example is the For Each (or Foreach) scope, which takes a collection
of data, usually extracted from the current input event, and applies the same
sequence of event processors to every item in the collection. For example, a
For Each scope might be used to process each individual row returned from a
database query or each individual line from a CSV file. See
xref:for-each-scope-concept.adoc[For Each Scope].

== Transformers

Transformers are components you can use to set or remove a part of the Mule event.
Transformers include:

* xref:remove-variable.adoc[Remove Variable]
* xref:set-payload-transformer-reference.adoc[Set Payload]
* xref:variable-transformer-reference.adoc[Set Variable]
