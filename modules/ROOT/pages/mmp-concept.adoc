The Mule Maven Plugin allows you to integrate the packaging, testing, and deployment of your Mule applications with your Maven lifecycle. +
This plugin allows you to deploy your Mule application to different deployment targets such as standalone runtimes, clustered instances, and CloudHub.

The Mule Maven Plugin supports both Community and Enterprise editions.

== Compatibility

* Mule 4.x
* Anypoint Studio 7.x

== Add the Mule Maven Plugin to a Mule Project

To add the Mule Maven Plugin, you need to add its maven dependency to the project:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.mule.tools.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.2.3</version>
  <extensions>true</extensions> //<1>
</plugin>
----

<1> It's important to enable extensions for this plugin.

From this repository:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
        <id>mule-public</id>
        <url>https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases</url>
    </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
----

This enables the Mule Maven Plugin in your project.

== Mule Application Packaging

The Mule Maven Plugin can package your Mule application into a deployable JAR file that you can later deploy to a running Mule Runtime. +
The package contains the application and all its dependencies whether those be JAR files required by the application or by its plugins.

Every Mule application has two descriptors. These descriptors tell the plugin how to handle your Mule application's dependencies.

* A `mule-artifact.json` file. +
This file describes how your application is composed. +

* A `pom.xml` file. +
This file describes all the dependencies required by the package to work properly.

==== Package a Mule App

. Make sure you added the Mule Maven Plugin to your `pom.xml` file.
. From the command line in your project's folder, run the package goal:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
> mvn clean package
----

The plugin packages your application and creates the deployable JAR file into the target directory within your project's folder. +

==== Import Your Generated JAR to Anypoint Studio.

If you want to import your generated JAR into Anypoint Studio, you need to package your application using the `-DattachMuleSources` option.

[source,console,linenums]
----
> mvn clean package -DattachMuleSources
----

The `-DattachMuleSources` argument tells the plugin to add a mule-src folder inside the META-INF directory with an exact copy of your application structure at design time.

== Mule App Structure Reference

At design time, your Mule application must have at least these three basic components:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols=",,"]
|===
| Component | Type | Description
| `src`
| Folder
| The source directory for your application's productive source code and tests. +
See a reference for this folder below.

| `pom.xml`
| Descriptor
| The POM file of your Mule application. +
This file describes all of your application's required dependencies.


| `mule-artifact.json`
| Descriptor
| The mule-artifact file of your Mule application. +
This file describes how your Mule application is composed.

|===

These three components are mandatory. If one is missing, the plugin won't package your project into a deployable JAR file. +
Additionally, the plugin does not consider any other directory or file in the root folder of your Mule application when packaging.


== Source Directory Reference

The `src` directory has two main folders: `main` and `test`. +
The plugin does not consider any other directory inside `src` when packaging the application.

=== src/main

src/main is the root folder for all the productive source code of the application.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols=",,"]
|===
|Folder  | Folder Type | Description

| `src/main/mule`
| source
| The root folder of the Mule configuration files. +
It can contain nested folders, in the way of Java packages.

This folder is mandatory.

| `src/main/resources`
| resource
| It contains the application resources, such as XML, JSON, and properties files. +
Jar files located here are loaded by the application classloader but as plain file resources.
|===

The plugin sends all files inside src/main/mule and src/main/resources to the root directory of your binary package. +
Nested folders within src/main/mule are preserved as directories within the root directory of the binary package.

=== src/test

src/test is the root folder for all the test source code of the application.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols=",,"]
|===
|Folder | Folder Type | Description

| `src/test/java`
| source
| It’s the root folder of the test classes used to validate the custom Java code of the app. +
It follows the conventions of any normal Java application.

| `src/test/munit`
| source
| It contains the MUnit source code. +
It can contain nested folders in the way of packages.

| `src/test/resources`
| resource
| It contains resources, such as XML, JSON,  and properties files. +
This folder also contains files describing metadata being referenced in the `mule-config.xml`.

|===

== Mule Application Deployment

The Mule Maven Plugin allows you to automate the deployment of your Mule application to your Mule servers. +

By default, this plugin allows you to deploy using five different deployment strategies:

* xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] deployment. +
Automate the deployment of your Mule application to CloudHub.
* xref:runtime-fabric::index.adoc[Runtime Fabric] deployment. +
Deploy your Mule Application to Runtime Fabric.
* xref:runtime-manager::runtime-manager-api.adoc[Runtime Manager REST API] deployment. +
Deploy your Mule application to your Mule server, or server clusters using the Runtime Manager REST API.
* Mule Agent deployment. +
Deploy your Mule Application using the Mule Agent. +
This deployment strategy only works if all your Mule Runtime instances live under the same address space.
* Standalone runtime deployment. +
Deploy to a runtime running on your machine.

When deploying an application using the Mule Maven Plugin you need to specify a valid deployment configuration in your `pom.xml` file. +
You can set up a deployment configuration using their dedicated deployment references.

== Deploy a Mule Application to CloudHub

=== Prerequisites

* The host and port number of your HTTP Listener flow sources are properly configured. +
+
If you are using the HTTP Listener as sources for your flow, you need to set its host to *0.0.0.0* and its port to *${http.port}*.
+
CloudHub then dynamically allocates a port at deployment time.
+
* All your external classes and resources are properly declared in the `mule-artifact.json` file of your Mule app.
+
Due to Mule 4.x classloading isolation mechanism, all external classes and resources must be explicitly declared in the "exportedPackages" and "exportedResources" fields on the `mule-artifact.json` file before packaging and deploying the app.
+
See xref:how-to-export-resources.adoc[Export Resources] to learn more about working with external resources in your Mule app.

=== Deploying to CloudHub

. Make sure you added the Mule Maven Plugin to your `pom.xml` file.
. Inside the plugin element, add a configuration for your CloudHub deployment as shown below:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
  ...
    <configuration>
        <cloudHubDeployment>
            <uri>https://anypoint.mulesoft.com</uri>
            <muleVersion>${mule.version}</muleVersion>
            <username>${username}</username>
            <password>${password}</password>
            <applicationName>${cloudhub.application.name}</applicationName>

            <properties>
                <key>value</key>
            </properties>
        </cloudHubDeployment>
    </configuration>

</plugin>
----
+
The example is using placeholder values. Configure each value with your CloudHub information.
. From the command line in your project's folder, package the app and run the deploy goal:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
> mvn clean package deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

=== Redeploying to CloudHub

== Encrypting credentials

Encrypted credentials are available in all platform deployments: CloudHub, Runtime Fabric, and Runtime Manager.
To use encrypted credentials when deploying, you need to set up your Maven master encrypted password and your `settings-security.xml` file.

. Create a master password for your Maven configuration.
+
----
> mvn --encrypt-master-password <yourMasterPassword>
----
+
Maven returns your master password encrypted:
+
----
{l9vZ2uM5SdgHy+H12z4pX7LEOZn3Kbnqmt3kIquLjnQ=}
----
+
. Create a `settings-security.xml` file in your ~/.m2 repository and add your encrypted master password.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<settingsSecurity>
  <master>{l9vZ2uM5SdgHy+H12z4pX7LEOZn3Kbnqmt3kIquLjnQ=}</master>
</settingsSecurity>
----
+
. Encrypt your Anypoint platform password:
+
----
> mvn --encrypt-password <yourAnypointPlatformPassword>
----
+
Maven returns your Anypoint platform password encrypted:
+
----
{HTWFGH5BG9QmvJ1B=}
----
. Add your encrypted Anypoint Platform password to your `settings.xml` file in the <server> section:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<settings>
 ...
  <servers>
   ...
    <server>
      <id>my.anypoint.credentials</id>
      <username>my.anypoint.username</username>
      <password>{HTWFGH5BG9QmvJ1B=}</password>
    </server>
   ...
  </servers>
 ...
</settings>
----
. In your configuration deployment, reference the credentials injecting the server id configured in your `settings.xml` file.
Below is an example of a CloudHub Deployment using encrypted credentials:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
  ...
    <configuration>
        <cloudHubDeployment>
            <uri>https://anypoint.mulesoft.com</uri>
            <muleVersion>${mule.version}</muleVersion>
            <server>my.anypoint.credentials</server>
            <applicationName>${cloudhub.application.name}</applicationName>
            <environment>${environment}</environment>
            <properties>
                <key>value</key>
            </properties>
        </cloudHubDeployment>
    </configuration>

</plugin>
----

NOTE: Make sure that username and password are not set in the deployment configuration, as they have precedence over the defined server id.

== Skipping Plugin Execution

You can skip the plugin execution by setting the `skip` flag to true inside your deployment configuration:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
  ...
  <configuration>
    <standaloneDeployment>
      <muleHome>${mule.home.test}</muleHome>
      <skip>true</skip>
    </standaloneDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

== Skipping Deployment Verification

You can skip the status verification of your deployed app by setting the `skipDeploymentVerification` flag to true inside of any of the platform deployments (Cloudhub, Runtime Manager, and Runtime Fabric):

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.mule.tools.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${mule.maven.plugin.version}</version>
  <extensions>true</extensions>
  <configuration>
    <runtimeFabricDeployment>
      ...
      <skipDeploymentVerification>true</skipDeploymentVerification>
      ...
    </runtimeFabricDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

If the `skipDeploymentVerification` flag is not present, the default value is false. +
This feature is available in plugin version 3.2.5 and later.

== Anypoint Runtime Manager On-Premises TLS Errors

When trying to connect to an instance of Runtime Manager that's on an  xref:1.5@private-cloud::index.adoc[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition] installation, the plugin validates certificates for that server. If you haven't installed the server certificates in your truststore, an SSL error occurs. To avoid this problem, you can run the plugin in an insecure mode, which skips the security validations. You can use the *armInsecure* tag or the *arm.insecure* system property.

[WARNING]
Enabling an insecure connection is a dangerous practice. Don't use this unless you know what you are doing and your On-Premises installation is isolated in a local network.

See the configuration example below:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
  ...
    <configuration>
      <armDeployment>
          <target>${target}</target>
          <targetType>${target.type}</targetType>
          <username>${username}</username>
          <password>${password}</password>
          <environment>${environment}</environment>
          <armInsecure>true</armInsecure>
      </armDeployment>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----
