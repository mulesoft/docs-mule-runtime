It's time to roll up your sleeves and build your first Mule application in Anypoint Studio!

The objective of this tutorial is get something built and running fast, so this document doesn't
spend much time explaining components.
This tutorial shows you how to create a simple application in Studio, deploy it to Studio's embedded server,
and then interact with the application through a Web browser.


== Assumptions


This tutorial assumes that you have xref:5@studio::to-download-and-install-studio.adoc[installed, and launched Anypoint Studio], and that you've read through the xref:5@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio Essentials].

== Creating a New Project

. In Anypoint Studio, click *File* then select *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Studio opens the *New Mule Project* wizard. In the *Project Name* field, enter the value `My First Project`, then click *Finish*.
+

+
. Studio opens a new blank project. The following quick reference explains the different views you use to build a Mule project:
+
image::blank-canvas.png[blank+canvas]
+
. Drag and drop an *HTTP Connector* from the *palette* onto the *canvas*. Studio wraps the connector with a *flow*.
+
image::add-http.png[add+http]
+
. Add a *Set Payload Component* to your flow by dragging it next to the HTTP connector.
+
image::set-payload.png[set+payload]
+
. Use Message Flow and Configuration XML tabs below the canvas for alternating between visual and XML editing. Click the *Configuration XML* tab to see your application represented in XML.
+
image::xml-code.png[xml+code]
+
. Click the *Message Flow* tab to return to the graphical editor.
+
. Click the *Save* icon to save your project.

== Configuring the Project

Now that you've modeled a basic application in Studio, you can follow the steps in this section to configure each individual element. The first element to configure is the HTTP Connector. The HTTP Connector allows your Mule application to connect to Web resources through the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
First, you set required HTTP Connector properties:

* Path
* Connector Configuration
* Name
* Host
* Port

You also create a Global Element for the HTTP Connector to reference. The Global Element encapsulates some reusable configuration properties. Multiple connectors can reuse the Global Element.

To configure the project:

. Click the HTTP Connector on the canvas to open its properties editor.
+
. *Path* is already populated by the default value, slash `/`. For this example, accept the default values in *Connector Configuration*, or change *Host* to *localhost*.
+
. Click the green plus sign (`+`) next to *Connector Configuration* to create a new *Global Element*.
+
image::add-global-element.png[add+global+element]
+
. In Global Element Properties, accept the default values for all fields, and click *OK* to close the window.
+
image::global-element-default.png[global+element+default]
+
The *Connector Configuration* field is now populated with a reference to the element you just created. The red warning marks disappear from the properties editor and the representation for the connector on the canvas.
+
. Click the *Set Payload Component* on the canvas to open its properties editor in the console.
+
The Set Payload Component simply sets the message payload to a value you define.
+
. Set the *Value* field to `Hello World!` for example.
+
image::set-payload-hello-world.png[set+payload+hello+world]
+
. Once again, click the *Configuration XML* to view your changes in the XML configuration tab:

== Deploying the Project


Anypoint Studio embeds a server that you use for testing deployments as you code. You can deploy your application on the embedded server to see it working and perform any debugging activities before deploying to a production environment, such as an xref:runtime-manager::deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[on-premises server] or xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub].


. In the *Package Explorer*, right-click the project name, then select *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
+
image::run-as.png[run+as]
+
. Studio launches the application on the embedded server, displaying its actions in the console. When complete, the console message reads: `Started app 'my_first_project'`
+
image::console1.png[]


== Interacting with the Project

. Open a Web browser.
. Navigate to the URL of your application, the default set by HTTP Connector properties:
+
`http://localhost:8081`
+
. The application accepts the request via its HTTP endpoint, then the set payload component sets the payload to "Hello World!", and finally the HTTP connector returns this payload to your browser.
+
image::hello-world.png[hello+world]
+
. In Studio, stop the application from running using the *Terminate* icon in the console:
