Mule provides a suite of example materials to help you learn more about building applications in Anypoint™ Studio and Mule ESB Standalone.

== Template Applications

Mule templates offer pre-packaged solutions to common integration scenarios, you may barely need to add your user credentials to the project's configuration files for them to be ready to deploy.

xref:the-template-library.adoc[Read more about the template library]

== Example Applications

Mule example applications offer insight into how you can use Mule to manage system connection and integration situations. Based on real-life business use cases, the examples demonstrate Mule's features and functionality and suggest how you can take advantage of them.

* In *Anypoint Studio*, Mule's graphical interface, a set of example applications exist in the form of *example* *templates* which you can use to build a Mule application without having to start from scratch.
* In *Mule ESB Standalone*, (Mule without Studio) a different set of example applications exist as files in the *examples* folder of the product distribution. You can access these example applications from your computer's console, using them as foundations upon which to build your own apps.

[discrete]
==== Create

. If you haven't already done so, visit http://www.mulesoft.org[www.mulesoft.org] and download http://www.mulesoft.org/download-mule-esb-community-edition[Mule ESB with Anypoint Studio] for free. Follow the instructions on the website to launch *Anypoint Studio* and select a workspace.
. Click the *File* menu, then select **New > Mule Example Project**.
. In the *New Mule Example Project* wizard, click to select a *Runtime*, then click to select a *Template*. +

+

+

xref:adding-community-runtime.adoc[How do I get Mule Community runtime?] +
 +
. Adjust the *Project Name*, if you wish, then click *Finish* to open the new example project, complete with pre-built and pre-configured flows. +

[discrete]
==== Run

. In the *Package Explorer* pane in Studio, right-click the project name, then select **Run As > Mule Application**. Studio runs the application and Mule is up and kicking!

[discrete.view]
=== Standalone

[discrete]
==== Create

. If you haven't already done so, download the http://www.mulesoft.org/download-mule-esb-community-edition[*Mule ESB standalone Community Runtime*] for free. (Scroll down to the table below the main portion of the page for the Standalone Community runtime. (Alternatively, download a trial version of http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-open-source-esb[**Mule ESB Enterprise (with Management Tools***)*].
. Navigate to the folder on your local drive that contains your copy of Mule ESB Standalone runtime.
. Locate the `Examples` folder, then the folder for the example you wish to run.
. Copy the pre-built application archive (the `.zip` file) for the example.
. Paste the copy of the `.zip` file into `$MULE_HOME/apps`. +
For example, to run the Hello World example, copy `mule-example-hello-3.5.0.zip` then move the copy to the `$MULE_HOME/apps` folder.  +

+
image::examplespath.png[]
+

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can build the example in a build tool such as *Ant* or *Maven*.

.. Run `ant` or `mvn` in your Ant or Maven build tool, respectively.
.. The build tool compiles the example classes, produces an application zip file and copies it to your `$MULE_HOME/apps` folder.
====

. Start Mule.
+

[TIP]
====
*Need more detail?*
.. Open a new command line.
*Windows*: Open the *Console*.
*Mac*: Open the *Terminal* application (Applications > Utilities > Terminal).
.. Access the directory in which your Mule instance is installed. For example, type `cd /Users/aaron/Downloads/mule-standalone-3.5.0/`
.. To start Mule, type `./bin/mule`
====

 . After it starts, Mule polls the `apps` folder every 5 seconds; it picks up the application you copied to the `apps` folder, then deploys it automatically. In the first command line, Mule notifies you that it has deployed the example application.
. To stop Mule, hit *CTRL-C*.
