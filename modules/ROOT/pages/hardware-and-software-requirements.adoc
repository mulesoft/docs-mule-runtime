If you plan to install Mule and run it on premises, review these minimum hardware and software requirements before you install.

== Minimum Hardware Requirements

* 2 GHz CPU or 1 virtual CPU in virtualized environments
* 1 GB of RAM. Add RAM to match your latency requirements, or to support large simultaneous messages or a large number of simultaneous messages if your applications process them.
* 4 GB of storage

== Minimum Software Requirements

Verify that you use a supported version of Java and a supported operating system before you install Mule.

If you use an application server or need to access a data store, verify that you use a supported application server or database.

=== Supported Java Versions

* Oracle JDK 1.8.0 (JDK 1.8.0_161 recommended)
* IBM JDK 1.8
* OpenJDK 8 (JDK 1.8.0_162 recommended)

=== Supported Operating Systems

* MacOS 10.11.4
* HP-UX 11i V3
* AIX 7.2
* Windows Server 2016 (recommended), Windows 2012 R2 Server, Windows 10 (recommended), or Windows 8.1
* Solaris 11.3
* RHEL 7
* Ubuntu Server 15.04 or 16.04, or any other Linux distribution that runs a supported JDK and Linux kernel 3.13

=== Application Servers

An application server is not required because Mule runs as a standalone server. However, Mule can run under one of these supported application servers:

* Tomcat 7 and 8
* WebLogic 12c
* WebSphere 8
* WildFly 8 or 9
* Jetty 8 or 9

=== Additional Requirements

* If you use the Microsoft Dynamics GP connector, install Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 8 after installing JRE or JDK.
* If you need to access a data store, a database is required. Mule can access any of the following supported databases:
+
** Mule Oracle 11g
** Oracle 12c
** MySQL 5.5+
** IBM DB2 10
** PostgreSQL 9
** Derby 10
** Microsoft SQL Server 2014
