If you plan to install Mule and run it on premises, review these minimum hardware and software requirements before you install.

== Minimum Hardware Requirements

* 2 GHz CPU or 1 virtual CPU in virtualized environments
* 1 GB of RAM. Add RAM to match your latency requirements, or to support large simultaneous messages or a large number of simultaneous messages if your applications process them.
* 4 GB of storage

== Supported Software and Systems

Verify that you use a supported version of Java and a supported operating system before you install Mule.

Mule Runtime runs as a standalone server; therefore an application server is not required. However, if you use an application server or need to access a data store, verify that you use a supported application server or database.
