Use an *attachment transformer* to set, remove, or copy attachments on the outbound scope of a message. To learn more about message scopes, refer to xref:3.7@mule-concepts.adoc[Mule Concepts].

Each Mule message consists of two parts. The *header* contains metadata pertaining to the message, such as the *message type* and the *encoding* protocol used to format the payload. The *payload* holds the data that typically gets processed by the Mule application flow, then dispatched to one or more external parties. This payload may also include a sub-section that holds any *attachments* (such as text, images, or applications) that travel with the message.

When an attachment is received into a flow along with its associated message, it is considered an *inbound property*, and it remains active (i.e., affixed to its parent message) as long as that message remains within the same flow. Note that the attachment does not automatically become part of the processed message that gets sent out of the flow by the outbound connector. For that to happen, you must explicitly make it an *outbound property* by reattaching it to the message with the *attachment transformer*. Alternatively, you can designate a different attachment to leave the flow along with the processed message.

The attachment transformer can use expressions that evaluate the content of the current message as well as the current state of the Mule environment in order to make a runtime determination as to which specific attachment leaves the flow with the current message. For example, the Attachment transformer can retrieve a photo that matches some content in the message payload and affix it to the message.

== Attachments and Transports

The attachment transformer is very similar in functionality to the xref:3.6@property-transformer-reference.adoc[property transformer]. However, attachments are only supported by the following transports:

* Axis
* Email
* HTTP
* VM

If you use the attachment transformer to affix an attachment to to a message and the message then exits the flow via a transport that does not support attachments, the attachments will be lost.

Customize to display a unique name for the transformer in your application, as shown in the examples above.

Note: Attribute not required in Mule Standalone configuration.

|*attachmentName* a|
The name of the attachment that you are setting, copying, or removing. Can be a string or a Mule expression.

Note: If you are using the remove-attachment or copy-attachments element, you may use a wildcard "*" character. For example, a copy-attachments transformer with an attachment name "IMG*" will copy all attachments whose names begin with "IMG", from the inbound scope to the outbound scope.

|*value* |The value of the attachment that you are setting. This attribute is only relevant for the set-attachment element. Can be a string or a Mule expression.
|*contentType* a|
The MIME format for the attachment string.
