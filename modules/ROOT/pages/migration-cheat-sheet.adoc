To help you move from Mule 3 to Mule 4, we built this index to help you find the Mule 4 equivalent of the most common Mule 3 use cases.

*IMPORTANT:* Keep in mind that this index is only intended to act as a quick entry to the most common migration scenarios. It doesn't contain the entire migration guide. For the full set of migration articles, please visit our Mule xref:index-migration.adoc[Mule 4 for Mule 3 Users] page.

* xref:configuring-properties.adoc[Configuration Properties]: There's a new way of handling configuration properties in Mule 4
* xref:migration-secure-properties-placeholder.adoc[Using Secure Properties]: Secure placeholders are now a Runtime feature and no longer part of the Security Module
