To help you move from Mule runtime engine (Mule) 3 to Mule 4, use this list to help you find the Mule 4 equivalent of the most common Mule 3 use cases.

*IMPORTANT:* This list is a quick reference for the most common migration scenarios. It doesn't contain the entire migration guide. For the full set of migration articles, please visit xref:index-migration.adoc[Mule 4 for Mule 3 Users].

* xref:configuring-properties.adoc[Configuration Properties]: There's a new way of handling configuration properties in Mule 4.
* xref:migration-secure-properties-placeholder.adoc[Using Secure Properties]: Secure placeholders are now a Runtime feature and no longer part of the Security Module.
* xref:migration-connectors-http.adoc[Using the HTTP Connector]: The new HTTP connector has some differences with Mule 3, especially when it comes to handling multipart and form requests.
* xref:migration-mel.adoc[From MEL to DataWeave]: DataWeave 2.0 is now the expression language. Here's how to adapt your MEL expressions to DataWeave.
* xref:migration-dataweave.adoc[From DataWeave 1.0 to DataWeave 2.0]: A new version of DataWeave is available in Mule 4.
* Where are the explicit transformers?: Transformers like `<object-to-string />` or `<object-to-json>` are no longer necessary. Mule handles this automatically under the covers.
* xref:connectors::object-store/object-store-to-define-a-new-os.adoc[Define a Custom Object Store]: Custom object stores are now defined through the new connector.
* xref:migration-patterns-watermark.adoc[Use watermarks]: Watermarks have been simplified. You can update them automatically in some cases, or manually to allow for more complex use cases.
* xref:migration-message-properties.adoc[Accessing the Mule Message]: The Mule message has a new structure and it's accessed differently. Here's a quick overview.
* Using Java: Interoperability with Java is now done through the xref:connectors::java/java-module.adoc[Java module]. Optionally you can also try the xref:migration-module-scripting.adoc[Scripting module] or the xref:mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK].
* xref:migration-module-spring.adoc[Using Spring]: Instead of defining Spring beans directly in your application, use the xref:connectors::spring/spring-module.adoc[Spring Module].
* xref:migration-patterns-reconnection-strategies.adoc[Using reconnection strategies]: Review the small but important differences related to reconnection in Mule 4.
* xref:migration-munit.adoc[From MUnit 1.0 to Munit 2.0]: Adapt your tests for Mule 4.
* xref:about-classloading-isolation.adoc[Classloading isolation]: Classloading isolation changes the way resources and classes are shared.
* xref:migration-core.adoc[Core Components Migration]: Changes were made to the core language elements.
* xref:migration-connectors.adoc[Using the new connectors]: Changes that were made to the main connectors.
* xref:migration-aes.adoc[Using the Security Module (AES)]: The Anypoint Enterprise Security module was split into different modules.
* xref:migration-api-gateways.adoc[Migrating Gateways]: This section covers the migration of the features related to API gateway.
* xref:migration-example-complex.adoc[Migrating Apikit Apps]: Migrate APIkit-based applications.
* Migrating custom components: Use the xref:mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK] to create your own reusable components.
* Migrating DevKit-based components: xref:mule-sdk::dmt.adoc[DevKit Migration Tool] helps you migrate DevKit projects for Mule 3 into Mule SDK projects.
* xref:migration-transports.adoc[Transport service overrides]: Migrate services from generic transports.
