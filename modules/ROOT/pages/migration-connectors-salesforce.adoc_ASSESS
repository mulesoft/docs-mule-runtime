Bogdan says, "all the operations from the old connector are in the new one."

//TODO: Figure out how we might be able to use these demo apps. Nathan says this:"For salesforce connector, we already migrated demo apps with the connector from Mule 3 to Mule 4. That might be a good staring point.

Mule 3: https://github.com/mulesoft/salesforce-connector/tree/mule-module-sfdc-8.4.0/demo
Mule 4: https://github.com/mulesoft/salesforce-connector/tree/mule-sfdc-connector-9.0.0/demo"

Initial contact with Nathan and Bogdan via Slack on 1/11."
