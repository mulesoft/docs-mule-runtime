Mule uses a dedicated toolkit to facilitate the development and exposure of REST APIs. *APIkit* is a simple framework that caters to API-first development, enforcing good API implementation practices. Rather than spending weeks or months building an API, you can use this toolkit to develop, document, and test your API within a few days or even hours.
