Sources are a very important part of any Mule app. When added to a flow, they serve as the entry point for information, linking any external communication protocol with internal Mule processing.

Examples of sources are:

* xref:connectors::http/http-connector.adoc[HTTP:Listener]
* xref:connectors::file/file-connector.adoc[FILE:Directory Listener]

== Configuring Sources

Even though each source implementation will have different configuration parameters, some common ones are worth mentioning.

=== Redelivery Policy

A redelivery policy is a filter that is added to Mule Sources to prevent the dispatch of messages that are known to cause errors.

By adding a redelivery policy to a flow's source, the received data will be  evaluated _prior to_ executing the flow's components. If that data caused failures multiple times in the past, the redelivery policy will prevent the flow from processing it and a `REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED` error will be raised instead.

This behavior prevents the runtime from wasting resources by executing a flow with poisoned messages (messages that caused errors in previous executions).

[IMPORTANT]
Some connectors have their own logic for handling an error thrown by a redelivery policy. In such cases, check the documentation for the connector to which that source belongs. For example, the `http-connector` might return `429: TOO MANY REQUESTS`.

.Example:
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener path="exhaustRedelivery" config-ref="listenerConfig">
    <redelivery-policy maxRedeliveryCount="10" idExpression="#[payload.transaction.id]"/>
</http:listener>
----

==== Redelivery Policy Configuration Parameters

[%header,cols="20a,20a,20a,60a"]
|===
|Field |Type |Default Value |Description
|*Max Redelivery Count* |Number |5 |The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before raising a `MULE:REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED` error.
|*Use Secure Hash* |Boolean |True |Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message.
|*Message Digest Algorithm* |String |SHA-256 a|The secure hashing algorithm to use.

Note: If the payload of the message is a Java object (for instance, when received by a `vm` listener), this option will be ignored and the value returned by the payload's `hashCode()` method will be used.
|*ID Expression* |Expression|- | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. This property can only be set if `useSecureHash` is false.
|*Object Store* |String |An Object Store created by the `ObjectStoreManager`. Non-persistent, with an `entryTtl` of 300 SECONDS and an expiration interval of 6 SECONDS. |The Object Store where the redelivery counter for each message is to be stored. It can be configured as a reference or as an inner element. See xref:connectors::object-store/object-store-connector.adoc[Object Store connector]
|===

==== Redelivery Policy Functionality

The configured redelivery policy works as follows:

Each time a new message is received by the source, it gets digested. A key will be generated from the message, either by using the configured Message Digest Algorithm or by evaluating the ID Expression.

* If the processing flow causes an exception, a counter associated with it gets incremented. Once the counter reaches a value bigger than the configured `maxRedeliveryCount`, an `MULE:REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED` error will be thrown.
* If the processing flow does not cause an exception, its counter gets reset.

==== Throws

* MULE:REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED
+
When the number of executions that raise an error is greater than the configured `maxRedeliveryCount`.


==== Examples

Suppose that you want to log some information when a `maxRedeliveryCount` is reached:

[source,xml]
----
<flow name="logOnRedeliveryExhausted">
    <http:listener path="test" config-ref="listenerConfig">
        <redelivery-policy maxRedeliveryCount="2" useSecureHash="true"/>
    </http:listener>
    <flow-ref name="processData"/>
    <error-handler>
        <on-error-continue type="MULE:REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED">
            <logger message="Redelivery exhausted in http listener" level="ERROR"/>
        </on-error-continue>
    </error-handler>
</flow>
