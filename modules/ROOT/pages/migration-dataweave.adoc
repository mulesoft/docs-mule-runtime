[[dw_header]]
== DataWeave Header Content

Most of the header directives have been changed in DataWeave. The `%dw` directive is an exception. In most cases, MuleSoft removed the `%`, and in some cases the keyword is shortened.

[%header,cols=“1,1”]
|===
|DataWeave 1.0 |DataWeave 2.0 |
|`%dw 1.0`    |`%dw 2.0`|
|`%output`    |`output` |
|`%var`       | `var`   |
|`%function`  | `fun`   |
|`%namespace` | `ns`    |
|===

[[dw_flow_control]]
== Flow Controls

Flow control changed somewhat in DataWeave 2.

[[dw_flow_control_when_otherwise]]
=== When Otherwise

The `when otherwise` statement is replaced by `if else`, for example:

.Mule 3 Example: DataWeave 1
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
    orderStatus: "complete" when flowVars.purchaseOrderStatus == "C" otherwise "incomplete"
}
----

.Mule 4 Example: DataWeave 2
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
    orderStatus: if(vars.purchaseOrderStatus == "C") "complete" else "incomplete"
}
----

//TODO: Add another pair of examples to show how to migrate DataWeave 1.0's "unless otherwise" statement

[[dw_flow_control_pattern_matcher]]
=== Pattern Matcher

Pattern matching changed in DataWeave 2. It adds the keyword `case` and `else` (instead of `default`). You also no longer separate cases with commas (`,`) since they are now explicitly separated by the `case` keyword.

.Mule 3 Example: DataWeave 1
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
'world' match {
    :string -> true,
    default -> false
  }
----

.Mule 4 Example: DataWeave 2
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
'world' match {
    case is String -> true
    else -> false
  }
----

For type pattern matchers, the `is` keyword needs to be set.

[[dw_type_references]]
== Type References

The `:` was removed from the type references and are now all camel case, so `:string` is now `String`

[[dw_object_coercion]]
== Object Coercion

In DataWeave 1.0, selecting a key-value pair from an object required you to do something like this:

.Mule 3 Example: DataWeave 1
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%var payload = {a: 1, b:2}
---
payload.a as :object
----

The DataWeave 1.0 expression above returns `{a:1}`. Because this is a coercion, it is also included in the auto-coercion mechanism and generates undesired or unexpected results.

In DataWeave 2.0, the coercion is removed, and a new selector (`&`) is introduced to select key-value pair parenthesis.
//TODO: To select a key-value pair from an object or something like that?

.Mule 3 Example: DataWeave 2
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
var payload = {a: 1, b:2}
---
payload.&a
----

This expression also returns `{a:1}`.

[[dw_cond_key_value_parens]]
== Conditional Key-Value Parenthesis

In DataWeave 1.0, conditional key-value pairs are declared with the `when` keyword.

.Mule 3 Example: DataWeave 1
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
    (a: 1) when payload.product == "Mule"
}
----

In DataWeave 2.0, you use the `if` keyword.

.Mule 4 Example: DataWeave 2
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
{
    (a: 1) if payload.product == "Mule"
}
----

////
DataWeave 2.0 (packaged as part of Mule Runtime 4.0) introduces the following syntax changes over previous versions:

* Removed automatic coercion from Object to Array (implies, for example, that the `map` function no longer works over an Object).
// TODO: should they use mapObject instead? Maybe we should give an example.
* Updated version header to `%dw 2.0`.
* Removed `%` from all other directives.
* Changed all type names format, which are now written without a colon and with an upper case letter (for example, `String` instead of `:string`, as before), for example: `1 as String` returns `"1"``.
* All operators are now functions (for example, `upper()`, `typeOf()`). Therefore, they must include their arguments between parentheses, for example, `upper("hello")` and `typeOf("hello")`.
// TODO: IS THIS TRUE for all or just for those that take a single argument? We used to all all the functions operators.
* Custom functions are declared in the DataWeave header via the keyword `fun`, rather than `function`. For example, `fun funName(args) = body`
* The `..` operator is no longer used for selecting ranges (but still works as a descendants selector). Its functionality is replaced by `to`. Example: `[2 to 15]`.
* `when`, `unless` and `otherwise` are no longer used for conditional logic. They have been replaced by `if` and `else`. This requires that you change the order of the expression. Example: `if payload is(String) uppercase(payload)`.
* Binary functions (that take two arguments) support an alternative infix notation (arg1 function arg2). For example, `payload.*items contains "3"` instead of `contains(payload.*items, "3")`.
* New key-value pair selector (`.&`) returns all matching keys and values. It returns them as a single object containing these.
* New namespace selector (`.#`) returns the namespace used.
* The function `groupBy` is overloaded to operate on objects.
* The new function `filterObject` can be used to filter objects.
* The functions `map`, `mapObject` and `filter` support a null input (in which case they return null).
* New supported syntax for `match` when using arrays `[head ~ tail]`
* Namespace prefixes can no longer contain the character `-`.
* Multiple functions are no longer packaged as part of the core functions module. The package they belong to must be manually imported in the header before they can be called.
* Index parameter: Added `index` as a third parameter to `mapObject`, `pluck`, `filter`, and `groupBy`.
* Closed objects: For declared types, added the pipe (`|`) syntax to specify a closed (or exact) object. For example, if `{|a: String|}` is specified as a return type of a function, the function cannot return `{a: String, b: Number}`.
* Ordered objects: Added the hyphen character (`-`) for ordered objects, for example: `{- a: String, b: Number -}`. The fields must be in the specified order.
* Repeated fields: Added the asterisk (`\*`) for repeated fields in an object, for example: `{ a*: String}`. This is primarily needed for XML, where the names of child elements can be repeated, unlike keys in Java and JSON objects.
* For the flat file, the content type is `application/flatfile` instead of `text\plain`.

TODO IN SEPARATE TOPIC, POINTING TO DW TYPES PAGE.
Declaring DW types
declare the type of a variable or of a function param or return, e.g.,
fun foo(arg1: {|a: String|}): String = arg1.a
`{|a: String|}` is the type of arg1

var message: String = "foo"
var user: {name*: String } = {name: "Mariano", name: "Leandro"}
var a: Array<Number> = [1,2,3]

for example, our `map` function
fun map <T,R>(lhs: Array<T>, rhs: (T, Number) -> R ): Array<R>
this signature says that it has 2 type parameters, T and R

`lhs` is an argument of type `Array<T>` (edited)

which is an array of `something`

that will be defined when the user calls the function

`rhs` is a lambda function, that has 2 inputs (T, Number) and returns something of type R (edited)

and the `map` function returns something of type `Array<R>`
////


////
Passing Data in URI params:
when you pass data in URI parameters, you need to encode them using that format
if you have for example
```{
  "key1" : ["value", "value@"],
  "key 2": "value 1",
  "key3": "value",
  "key 4 her%": null
}

that has to be formatted as
```key1=value&key1=value%40&key+2=value+1&key3=value&key+4+her%25
```
when used as URI parameters

you put `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` as your output format
with the header `output application/x-www-form-urlencoded` in the script
