The table below maps Mule 3.x components to their Mule 4 equivalents.

[%header,cols="30,70"]
|===
| Mule 3.x Component | Mule 4.0 Replacement
| All router  | Use xref:scheduler-concept.adoc[Scatter Gather] instead or execute the operations one after the other with different target attributes and then use DW to merge results.
| async[‘processingStrategy’] | Async processing strategies are no longer needed with the non-blocking execution engine. Use an “async” scope wrapping all the components if you want them to behave asynchronously.
| asynchronous-processing-strategy | Async processing strategies are no longer needed with the non-blocking execution engine. Use an “async” scope wrapping all the components if you want them to behave asynchronously.
| bridge | Build an equivalent flow

| choice-exception-strategy| Use xref:on-error-scope-concept.adoc[error-handler] with different strategies inside using error type selection or when attribute.
| combine-collections-transformer | No longer needed with the simplified message model. MuleMessageCollections are replaced with arrays of Mule Messages, which can be merged or iterated through using any Mule component, such as DataWeave or foreach.

| file-queue-store | Use the new xref:migration-module-vm.adoc[VM Connector].
| flow[‘processingStrategy’] | Removed. Non blocking execution engine ensures that users do not need to tune this.

| processor | Depending on the nature of your expression, you can either use DataWeave (for data access expressions), xref:migration-module-scripting.adoc[Scripting module] or the xref:mule-sdk::index.adoc[Mule SDK] for algorithmic expressions, or the xref:connectors::java/java-module.adoc[Java module] for expressions which simply access Java.

| scatter-gather[‘threading-profile’] | No longer needed now that Mule 4 is non blocking.
