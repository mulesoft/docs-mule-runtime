This section covers the migration of component-specific features, and the table below maps Mule 3.x components and expressions to their replacements in Mule 4.

[%header,cols="30,70"]
|===
| Mule 3.x Component | Mule 4.0 Replacement
| All router  | Use scatter gather instead or execute the operations one after the other with different target attributes and then use DW to merge results.
| async[‘processingStrategy’] | Async processing strategies are no longer needed with the non-blocking execution engine. Use an “async” scope wrapping all the components if you want them to behave asynchronously.
| asynchronous-processing-strategy | Async processing strategies are no longer needed with the non-blocking execution engine. Use an “async” scope wrapping all the components if you want them to behave asynchronously.
| bridge | Removed. Use flows.
| catch-exception-strategy | Use error-handler with an on-error-continue strategy.
| choice-exception-strategy| Use error-handler with different strategies inside using error type selection or when attribute.
| combine-collections-transformer | No longer needed with the simplified message model. MuleMessageCollections are replaced with arrays of Mule Messages, which can be merged or iterated through using any Mule component, such as DataWeave or foreach.
| component | Use the Java module.
| composite-source | Create one flow per each source and invoke a private flow using flow-ref for the common functionality.
| configuration[‘defaultExceptionStrategy-ref’] | New name is defaultErrorHandler-ref
| configuration[‘flowEndingWithOneWayEndpointReturnsNull’] | No longer needed with new execution engine.
| configuration[‘useExtendedTransformations’] | Removed.
| configuration[enricherPropagatesSessionVariableChanges] | Removed.
| copy-attachments | Use Transform component & DataWeave.
| copy-properties | Use Transform component & DataWeave.
| custom-agent | Removed.
| custom-aggregator | Removed.
| custom-connector | Use SDK to build a custom connector.
| custom-exception-strategy | No longer needed. Use error-handlers.
| custom-lifecycle-adapter-factory | No replacement.
| custom-object-store | Use object store module extension to create custom stores.
| custom-processor | Use DataWeave, scripting component, the Mule SDK , or the Java module.
| custom-queue-store | Use the new VM Connector.
| custom-router-resolver | Removed.
| custom-router | Removed.
| custom-service | Use flows.
| custom-source | Use the Mule SDK to write a new event source.
| custom-splitter | Use DataWeave or the Mule SDK.
| custom-transaction-manager | Removed.
| custom-transaction | Removed.
| default-exception-strategy | Use error-handler with an on-error-propagate strategy.
| default-in-memory-queue-store | Use the new VM Connector.
| default-persistent-queue-store | Use the new VM Connector.
| default-service-exception-strategy | Use error-handler with an on-error-propagate strategy.
| endpoint | Use connectors.
| exception-strategy | Use error-handlers.
| expression-component | Use DataWeave, scripting component, the Mule SDK, or the Java module.
| file-queue-store | Use the new VM Connector.
| flow[‘processingStrategy’] | Removed. Non blocking execution engine ensures that users do not need to tune this.
| idempotent-message-filter | Replaced by idempotent-message-validator.
| idempotent-redelivery-policy | New name is redelivery-policy.
| idempotent-secure-hash-message-filter | Replaced by idempotent-message-validator
| in-memory-store | Use object store module extension to create custom stores.
| inbound-endpoint | Use connectors.
| include-entry-point | Use the Java module.
| interceptor-stack | Removed. Use custom policies.
| invoke | Use the Java module.
| jndi-transaction-manager | Removed.
| jrun-transaction-manager | Removed.
| legacy-abstract-exception-strategy | Use the new error handlers.
| managed-store | Use object store module extension to create custom stores.
| message-properties-transformer | Use Transform component and DataWeave.
| model | Removed. Use flows instead.
| mule[‘version’] |
| outbound-endpoint | Element moved from the core namespace to the new transports namespace.
| parse-template |
| poll -> watermark | This capability has been built inside event sources from many connectors, like Salesforce, Database, SFTP, File, etc. You can also use the object-store module to manually set the watermark values.
| poll | Replaced with scheduler source.
| pooling-profile[‘disabled’] | New attribute
| processor | Use DataWeave, scripting component, the Mule SDK, or the Java module.
| prototype-object | Use Java module or Spring module.
| queue-profile | Removed.
| queue-store | Removed.
| recipient-list | Removed.
| reconnect-custom-notifier | Removed.
| reconnect-custom-notifier | Removed.
| reconnect-custom-strategy | Removed.
| reconnect-custom-strategy | Removed.
| reconnect-notifier | Removed.
| remove-attachment | No longer needed. Attachments can be stored as variables.
| remove-property | Properties no longer exist in the new message model. You can store attributes from the Mule message in a variable.
| response | Removed. No longer needed.
| request-reply | Mule 4 will not longer support request-reply for all connectors. Connectors that had a “request-reply” behavior will provide a “request-reply” operation built in, such as the JMS consume operation.
| resin-transaction-manager | Removed.
| rollback-exception-strategy | Use error-handler with an on-error-propagate strategy.
| scatter-gather[‘threading-profile’] | No longer needed now that Mule 4 is non blocking.
| seda-model | No more SEDA queues in Mule 4. The execution engine in Mule 4 is non-blocking.
| service | Use flows.
| set-attachment | No longer needed. Attachments can be stored as variables.
| set-property | Properties no longer exist in the new message model. You can store attributes from the Mule message in a variable.
| set-session-variable | Session variables have been removed. Users must explicitly pass headers across transport boundaries.
| simple-in-memory-queue-store | Use the new VM Connector.
| simple-service | Use flows.
| simple-text-file-store | Use object store module extension to create custom stores.
| singleton-object | Use Java module or Spring module.
| spring-object | Use Java module or Spring module.
| synchronous-processing-strategy | The behavior related to flow components execution is the same as flows in 4.x but it doesn't always execute in the same thread as in 3.x.
| transactional scope | Replaced with “try” scope.
| username-password-filter | Removed.
| validator | Removed.
| weblogic-transaction-manager | Removed.
| websphere-transaction-manager |
| all-strategy | Removed.
| entry-point-resolver | Use the Java module.

| message-info-mapping | Removed.
| point-resolver-set | Use the Java module.
| router | Removed.
| threading-profile | Removed. The Runtime now tunes itself.
| transformer | Removed. Most explicit transformations are no longer needed. Use DataWeave for the corner cases.
