From a DataWeave statement, you can call Java Methods from any Java class that's in your Mule project. Note that you can only call Static methods via DataWeave (methods that belong to a Java class, not methods that belong to a specific instance of a class).


== Call a Java Method


Before you can call a method, you must first import the class it belongs to into your DataWeave code. You can import Java classes just as you import DataWeave modules by including `java!` into the statement.

For example, below is a simple Java class with a single method that appends a random number at the end of a string. Assume that you created this class as part of a Java package named "utils" in your Mule project's `src/main/java` folder.

[source,java,linenums]
----
package utils;

import java.util.Random;

public class MyUtils {

	public static String appendRandom(String base) {
		return base + new Random().nextInt();
	}

}
----

You can call the method `appendRandom()` from DataWeave code, in any of the following ways.

* Import the class and then refer to the method:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
import java!utils::MyUtils
output application/json
---
{
	a: MyUtils::appendRandom("myString")
}
----

* Import one or more methods instead of the whole class:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
import java!utils::MyUtils::appendRandom
output application/json
---
{
	a: MyUtils::appendRandom("myString")
}
----

* If the method is a static method, import and call it in a single line:
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
	a: #[java!utils::MyUtils::appendRandom(vars.myString)]
}
----

All three methods return the variable value with a random string appended:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "a":"myString969858409"
}
----

== Instantiate a Java Class

Through DataWeave code, you can instantiate a new object of any class. Note that after creating an instance, you can't call its instance methods via DataWeave, you can however reference its variables.


Below is a simple Java class, the class has a method and a variable.

[source,java,linenums]
----
package utils;
public class MyClass {

	private String foo;
	 public MyClass(String foo) {
		 this.foo = foo;
	}

	 public String getFoo() {
		return foo;
	}

}
----

The DataWeave example below first imports the "MyClass" class, then creates a new instance of it and calls its instance variable "foo". Note that even though the object has a method "getFoo()", it can't be called via DataWeave.


[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
import java!utils::MyClass
output application/json
---
{
	a: MyClass::new("myString").foo
}
----

This should output the following:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "a":"myString"
}
----
