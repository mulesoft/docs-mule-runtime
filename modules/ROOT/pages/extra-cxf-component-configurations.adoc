= Extra CXF Component Configurations
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

This page covers more complex configuration of the CXF Component than those described in the basic discussions of xref:3.6@publishing-a-soap-api.adoc[publishing a SOAP API] and xref:3.7@consuming-a-soap-api.adoc[consuming a SOAP API]. You may also wish to refer to full xref:3.6@cxf-component-reference.adoc[CXF Component Reference] documentation.

Using a Global CXF Configuration

To set up and reuse customized CXF behavior, you must create a *global element* and reference it within the CXF component(s) in your Mule flows. The following configuration information applies to all types of SOAP API Operations (service, client, and proxy).

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. On your canvas, click the *Global Elements* tab, then click the *Create* button, then select `CXF Configuration` from the list of available options under *Component configurations*.
+
[NOTE]
You can also create a *Global CXF Element* directly from the CXF component's properties editor. Next to the *Config Reference* field, click the image:add.png[(plus)] icon to open the *Global Element Properties* panel.
+

|===
|Field |Value |Description
|*Name* |unique name |Enter a unique name for the global element, if you wish.
|*Configuration Location* |filepath/filename.xml |If you have created an `.xml` file that supplies the specifics of how you want your CXF elements to behave, enter the file path of your CXF configuration file.
|*Enable Mule Soap Headers* |true (_default_) +
false  +
 +
*Note*: This field is currently not implemented and has no effect. |If set to true (i.e. checked) this attribute ensures that Mule can add a header to a SOAP message when required as part of the message's processing. +
For example, if your SOAP messages will be processed by a third-party schema which prohibits deviations from very specific message properties and will not process messages with Mule headers, set this attribute to false (i.e. uncheck).
|*Initialize Static Bus Instance* |true (_default_) +
false  |If set to true, (i.e. checked) this attribute ensures that the CXF SOAP API uses Mule transports instead of http://cxf.apache.org/docs/transports.html[CXF transports].
|===

. Click the  *Message Flow*  tab to return to your canvas.

. Open the Pattern Properties panel of the CXF component, again.

. Use the drop down menu in the *Config Reference* field to select the global CXF element you created.

== Adding Custom Interceptors

CXF uses chains of http://cxf.apache.org/docs/interceptors.html[interceptors] – the most basic processing unit – to process messages. As a message moves through an interceptor chain, each interceptor performs an action upon the message, such as reading it, transforming it, or validating it.

If you need to add an extra action to the messages processed by your CXF SOAP API (for instance, to add a header to a message), use the CXF component to add extra interceptors to the interceptor chain.
[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Open the properties editor, then click on the *Interceptors* tab.

. Click on the image:add.png[(plus)] icon to reveal the four  *http://cxf.apache.org/docs/interceptors.html[Interceptor Providers]* CXF uses to add interceptors to interceptor chains; click one of the choices to add an interceptor provider.

* `Add in Interceptor`
* `Add in Fault Interceptor`
* `Add out Interceptor`
* `Add out Fault Interceptor`
+
image::cxf-addint.png[CXF-addint]

. Double-click the newly created interceptor provider in the *Settings* pane to open the interceptor provider panel.
+
image::cxf-clickinter.png[CXF-clickinter]

. Use the drop down menu in the *Beans* field to select from your list of existing beans the one that will act as an interceptor.
+
[NOTE]
If you have not yet created any beans, click the *new* button to open a new *Properties Panel* that facilitates the creation and configuration of new a bean, which imports the Java class you have built to specify the interceptor's behavior.
+
image::studio-interceptorssettings.png[Studio-interceptorssettings]

. Click the *add to list* button to insert the selected bean into the interceptor chain.
. Click *Finish*, then *OK* to save your interceptor configurations.

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor or Standalone

. Above all flows in your Mule project, create a global ` spring:bean ` element to import the Java class you have built to specify the interceptor's behavior. Refer to code sample below.

. To the CXF element in your flow, add a child element according to the type of action you want the interceptor to perform:
* `cxf:inInterceptor`
* `cxf:inFaultInterceptor`
* `cxf:outInterceptor`
* `cxf:outFaultInterceptor`

. As a child element of the CXF interceptor element, add a reference to the spring bean, `spring:ref  bean`, you created which imports the Java class.

. Add as many as four interceptor child elements to your CXF service or client component.

|Configuration |Activity
|*WSDL Location* |In the *WSDL Location* field, enter the URL (relative or absolute) of the WSDL file which describes the functionality of the SOAP API.
|*MTOM Enabled* |Set *MTOM Enabled* to true (i.e. checked) if you want Mule to process the binary data sent as part of a SOAP message. (http://cxf.apache.org/docs/mtom.html[Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism])
|*Enable Mule Soap headers* a|
By default, *Enable Mule Soap Headers* is set to true (i.e. checked); this ensures that Mule can add a header to a SOAP message when required as part of the message's processing. Set to false (i.e. unchecked) if you do not want Mule to add headers to SOAP messages. For example, if your SOAP messages will be processed by a third-party schema which prohibits deviations from very specific message properties (such as added Mule headers), deactivate the *Enable Mule Soap Headers* box.

*Note*: This configuration is currently not implemented and has no effect.

|*Soap 1.1* +
 *Soap 1.2* |Use radio buttons to select the version of SOAP you want your service to use: SOAP 1.1 or SOAP 1.2. By default, Mule sets the version to SOAP 1.1.
|*Databinding* |Within the context of the CXF framework, http://cxf.apache.org/docs/data-binding-architecture.html[*data binding*] refers to the mapping of data from XML documents to Java objects. Use the drop down menu to select a data binding type that will meet your configuration requirements: +

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor or Standalone

. Within the context of the CXF framework, http://cxf.apache.org/docs/data-binding-architecture.html[*data binding*] refers to the mapping of data from XML documents to Java objects. You can specify the databinding of your client or service, if you wish. (Not configurable on proxy service or proxy client.) The following are the different types of databinding available:
*  http://cxf.apache.org/docs/aegis-21.html[aegis-databinding]
*  http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jaxb.html[jaxb-databinding]
* custom-databinding
*  http://jibx.sourceforge.net/[jibx-databinding]

. To the CXF element in your flow, add a child element according to the type of databinding you want your service or client to use:
* `cxf:aegis-databinding`
* `cxf:jaxb-databinding`
* `cxf:custom-databinding`
* `cxf:jibx-databinding`

. As a child element of the CXF databinding element, add one or more `spring:property` elements with either a name and value, or name and reference, to define any databinding properties. Refer to the code sample below.

. Define a `cxf:` `schemalocations` attribute, if you wish, to identify a namespace to which your service should refer. (Not configurable on JAX-WS client, simple client, or proxy client.) Reference http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms256100.aspx[schemaLocation] for additional details. To the CXF element in your flow (below any interceptor elements, if you have added any), add a ` cxf:schemaLocations ` child element.

. Within the `cxf:schemaLocations` element, add a `cxf:schemaLocation` child element, to specify the URL of the schema to which your service should refer. Refer to code sample below.

. As per your specific needs, configure any of the following CXF service or client attributes according to the table below. Refer to the code sample below.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Configuration |Activity
|*validationEnabled* |When set to true, validationEnabled ensures that Mule can add a header to a SOAP message when required as part of the message's processing. Set to false if you do not want Mule to add headers to SOAP messages. For example, if your SOAP messages will be processed by a third-party schema which prohibits deviations from very specific message properties (such as added Mule headers), set validationEnabled to false.
|*mtomEnabled* |Set mtomEnabled to true if you want Mule to process the binary data sent as part of a SOAP message. (http://cxf.apache.org/docs/mtom.html[Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism])
|*wsdlLocation* |Enter the URL (relative or absolute) of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language[WSDL file] which describes the functionality of the SOAP API.
|*soapVersion* |Identify the version of SOAP you want your service to use: http://www.w3.org/2003/06/soap11-soap12.html[SOAP 1.1 or SOAP 1.2]. By default, Mule uses SOAP 1.1.
