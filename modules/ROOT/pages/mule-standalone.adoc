You only need to install Mule rutnime engine (Mule), a production-strength runtime engine, if you host it in your own environment.

You don't need to worry about installation in the following instances:

* Use Anypoint Studio (Studio) for development and testing, because Studio contains Mule.
* Mulesoft hosts your instance of Mule.

Skip this section if you don't need to install Mule.

If you do need to install Mule, xref:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[verify that you meet hardware and software requirements], then xref:runtime-installation-task.adoc[download and install Mule].
