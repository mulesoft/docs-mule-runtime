You only need to install Mule, a production-strength runtime engine, if you host it in your own environment.

You don't need to worry about installation in the following instances:

* You use Studio for development and testing, because Studio contains Mule.
* Mulesoft hosts your instance of Mule.

Skip this section if you don't need to install Mule.
