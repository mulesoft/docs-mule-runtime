include::mule-runtime::partial$mmp-concept.adoc[tag=deprecatedVersionsWarning]

In addition to using Anypoint Studio, Anypoint Runtime Manager, or the Anypoint Platform CLI to deploy applications on-premises, you can also deploy Mule applications by using the Mule Maven plugin. To do so, you must meet certain prerequisites, and configure the desired deployment strategy in your project's `pom.xml` file.

If you want to deploy applications on-premises using a different method, see:

* xref:runtime-manager::deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[Deploy Applications On-Premises Using Runtime Manager]
* xref:anypoint-cli::standalone-apps.adoc#runtime-mgr-standalone-application-deploy[Deploy Applications On-Premises Using the Anypoint Platform CLI]
* xref:studio::import-export-packages.adoc#export-project-studio[Deploy Applications On-Premises Using Anypoint Studio]

== On-premises Deployment Strategies

When you deploy applications on-premises using the Mule Maven plugin, you can select three different methods for deployment:

* Standalone deployment +
By using this method you perform a manual deployment of your Mule application to your on-premises Mule instance.
* Runtime Manager REST API deployment +
This method enables you to deploy an application using the Runtime Manager REST API, which links your on-premises Mule instance with your Anypoint Runtime Manager account, where you can do further management and monitoring of your deployed application.
* Runtime Manager Agent deployment +
This method enables you to deploy an application using the Runtime Manager agent, which exposes a local API that you can call to manage and monitor your deployed application.

The Mule Maven plugin also supports deploying domains when using the standalone deployment strategy, or the Runtime Manager agent deployment strategy.

Additional operations enable you to deploy applications in parallel and update applications at runtime.

== Prerequisites

* Add the Mule Maven Plugin to your project
+
See xref:mmp-concept.adoc#add-mmp[Add the Mule Maven Plugin to a Mule Project] for instructions.

[[mmp-deploy-standalone]]
== Deploy a Mule Application to a Standalone Mule Runtime Engine

Inside the `plugin` element, add a configuration for your standalone deployment, replacing the placeholder values with your local Mule runtime engine information:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::mule-runtime::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <standaloneDeployment>
      <muleHome>${mule.home.test}</muleHome>
      <muleVersion>${app.runtime}</muleVersion>
    </standaloneDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

From the command line in your project's folder, package the application and execute the deploy goal:

[source,console,linenums]

=== Troubleshoot TLS Errors in Anypoint Private Cloud Edition

When trying to connect to an instance of Runtime Manager that's on an xref:private-cloud::index.adoc[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition] installation, the plugin validates certificates for that server. If you haven't installed the server certificates in your truststore, an SSL error occurs. To avoid this problem, you can run the plugin in an insecure mode, which skips the security validations. You can use the *armInsecure* tag or the *arm.insecure* system property.

[WARNING]
Enabling an insecure connection is a dangerous practice. Don't use this unless you know what you are doing and your On-Premises installation is isolated in a local network.

See the configuration example below:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::mule-runtime::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <armDeployment>
        <target>${target}</target>

[[deploy-a-domain]]
== Deploy a Domain

The Mule Maven plugin supports deploying domains only when using the standalone deployment strategy, or the Runtime Manager agent deployment strategy.

To deploy a domain, use the same configuration and deployment steps you use when deploying an application. For example, to deploy a domain to a standalone instance:

. Inside the `plugin` element, add a configuration for your standalone deployment, replacing the placeholder values with your local Mule runtime engine information:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
include::mule-runtime::example$mmp-concept-config.xml[]
  <configuration>
    <standaloneDeployment>
      <muleHome>${mule.home.test}</muleHome>
      <muleVersion>${app.runtime}</muleVersion>
    </standaloneDeployment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----
+
. From the command line in your project's folder, package the domain and execute the deploy goal:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
mvn clean deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

== Deploy Applications in Parallel

You can deploy applications in parallel to on-premises Mule instances. Deploying applications in parallel reduces the startup time when you deploy a large number of apps. To prevent deployment failure, ensure that applications are not dependent on each other because a particular start order cannot be guaranteed.

Parallelism is fixed at 20.

To enable parallel deployment:

. Package or export your Mule applications to the `/apps` directory of your Mule runtime engine instance.
. Start Mule using the `-M-Dmule.deployment.parallel` option:
+
```
mule -M-Dmule.deployment.parallel
```

After performing these steps, Mule deploys in parallel all applications in the `/apps` directory.

== Undeploy Applications

You can undeploy Mule applications by deleting an app's anchor file only instead of deleting the application folder directly.

Deleting only the app’s anchor file:

* Prevents any interference from the hot-deployment layer and leaves no room for concurrent conflicting actions.

* Avoids potential application JAR file locking issues on some operation systems and allows for clean shutdown and undeployment.

For example, if the `stockTrader` app is running (app folder is there as well as the `$MULE_HOME/apps/stockTrader-anchor.txt` file), just delete the anchor file to have the app removed from the Mule instance at runtime. Application folder is removed after the app terminates.

[NOTE]
After undeploying a Mule application, there is a timeout of 15 seconds until `LoggerContext` stops. Log files for an application only release after this timeout expires. This information is important in Windows, where you can’t remove files that are in use by other processes.

== Update Applications at Runtime

Updating a Mule application at runtime can be a complex change involving class modifications, endpoint modifications (for example, changing ports), and reconfiguring flows. An application update first performs a graceful app shutdown and then reconfigures itself in the background within seconds. This process is transparent for the users.


There are two ways you can update an application:

* By adding the modifications over an existing unpacked app folder and touching the main configuration file (`mule-config.xml` located in the app's root directory by default).
* By adding a new `jar` with an updated version of the app into the `$MULE_HOME/apps` directory. Mule detects the `jar` as an updated version of an existing application and ensures the update by a clean redeployment of the app. +
Note that Mule discards any modifications to the old application folder. The new app folder is a clean unpacked application from a `jar`.

Either method integrates well with existing build tools.
