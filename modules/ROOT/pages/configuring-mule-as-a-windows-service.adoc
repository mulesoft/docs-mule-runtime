To install Mule as a Windows NT Service, type:

----
mule install
----

To remove Mule from your server, type:

----
mule remove
----

After you install Mule as a service, you can start, stop, and restart Mule:

----
mule [start|stop|restart]
----

*Note:* When windows restarts, the Mule service stops the same way as using the `mule stop` command.
The only situation that this could be different is if Windows kills the process due to a timeout.

You can also use the Windows `net` utility:

----
net [start|stop] mule
----
