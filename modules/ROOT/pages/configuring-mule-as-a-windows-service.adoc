If you want to install Mule as a Windows NT Service, type

[source,text,linenums]
----
mule install
----

Likewise, to remove Mule from your services, type:

[source,text,linenums]
----
mule remove
----

Once you have installed Mule as a service, you can invoke the service exactly as you did before, but with an additional parameter:

[source,text,linenums]
----
mule [start|stop|restart]
----

You can also use the Windows `net` utility:

[source,text,linenums]
----
net [start|stop] mule
----
