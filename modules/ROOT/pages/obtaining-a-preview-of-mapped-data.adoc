= Obtaining a Preview of Mapped Data
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Anypoint™ DataMapper gives you the ability to preview the result of your data mappings before they are actually implemented. Once data mapping has been configured in a DataMapper building block, generating a preview requires the following steps:

* Go to DataMapper's *Preview* tab
* Click *Run Mapping*

== Requirements For Generating a Preview

You need to have a configured DataMapper building block in order to map data.

How to obtain a preview will depend on how Anypoint DataMapper is configured. *Preview* needs to read its input data from a file. If DataMapper is configured to read from an input file, then you can select that same input file to generate the preview from. But if DataMapper is configured to read from Java or from a map or list of maps, then there will be no input file for *Preview* to read from. In that case, you will need to provide an input file for *Preview* to work. Both cases are covered in the examples below.

== Examples

* <<Using Preview With CSV, XML, JSON Or Excel Input Files>>
* <<Using Preview With Java Or Mapping As Input>>

=== Using Preview With CSV, XML, JSON Or Excel Input Files

This example was originally provided in https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/5/mapping-elements-inside-lists[Mapping Elements Inside Lists]. The example illustrates a simple mapping from an XML file to JSON. You can follow the instructions to create the mapping and obtain the same results as in this document, or you can use this document to obtain a preview of your own mapping.

Once you have your DataMapper building block configured to map data, proceed to obtain the preview by following the steps provided below.

Input XML file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<contact_list type="members" id="id0">
  <contacts>
    <user name="John" lastname="Doe" phone="1111 1111"/>
    <user name="Jane" lastname="Doe" phone="2222 2222"/>
    <user name="Harry" lastname="Hausen" phone="3333 3333"/>
  </contacts>
  <emergency_contacts>
    <user name="Larry" lastname="Larson" phone="4444 4444"/>
    <user name="Harry" lastname="Harrison" phone="5555 5555"/>
    <user name="John" lastname="Johnson" phone="6666 6666"/>
  </emergency_contacts>
</contact_list>
----

Output JSON sample file:

[source,text,linenums]
----
{
  "type": "members",
  "id": "id0",
  "contacts": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "lastname": ""
    },
    {
      "name": "",
      "lastname": ""
    },
  ],
  "emergencyContacts": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "lastname": ""
    },
  ]
}

==== DataMapper's *Preview* Tab

Once the DataMapper building block is properly configured, locate the *Preview* tab in the DataMapper view (highlighted below):

image::1-preview.png[1.preview]

Click the *Preview tab*. The view will be similar to the following:

image::2-preview.png[2.preview]

The *Input sample data* input box defines the name of the input file whose data will be used for the preview. In this example, since the DataMapper building block has already been configured, the input box already contains the name of the input file (which was specified when configuring the DataMapper building block). You can select a different input file by clicking the ellipsis (**...**) button to the right of the *Input sample data* field.

==== Generating the Preview

Once the input file has been selected, click *Run Mapping* to generate the preview.

In this example, DataMapper generates a preview of the JSON output file:

image::3-preview.png[3.preview]

To see a graphical representation of the mapping, click the *Graphic View* tab:

image::4-preview.png[4.preview]

=== Using Preview With Java Or Mapping As Input

If your DataMapper building block has been configured to collect input data from Java, or from a map or list of maps, then there will be no input file to enable *Preview* to work. You will need to supply your own input file. This input file must contain a Groovy script to provide the input data.

In this example, the DataMapper building block has been configured to read input from a Java class called `User`, and outputs to a JSON file.

`User` Java class:

[source,java,linenums]
----
package org.mule.test;

public class User {
    private String name;
    private String lastName;

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

}

JSON sample output file:

[source, code, linenums]
----
[ { "name" : "Sally",
    "lastname" : "Sample"
  } ]
----
////

In this configuration, in order to generate a preview you will need to create an input file with a Groovy script that emulates the input Java class. To do so, complete the following steps:

. In the *Package Explorer* pane under the root folder for your project, locate a suitable directory for the new file. In this example, we will use `$\{Project_Home}/src/test/resources/`.
. Right-click the desired directory, then select *New*, then *File*.
. The *New File* window pops up. In the *File name* field, type a name for the new file. For this example, we will use `input.groovy`. +
 +
image::2_2-preview.png[2.2.preview]

. Click *OK*. Studio automatically opens the new file for editing in a new tab. +
+
image::2_3-preview.png[2.3.preview]

. In the new tab, write the Groovy script suitable for your mapping. For this example, we will use the following:

[source,java,linenums]
----
import org.mule.test.*;

User result = new User();
result.setName("John")
result.setLastName("Doe")
return result
----

It is now possible to generate a preview by selecting the newly-created file, `$\{Project_Home}/src/test/resources/input.groovy`, in DataMapper's *Preview* tab. To do so, complete the following steps:

. Go to DataMapper's *Preview* tab.
. Select the file `input.groovy`. This can be done in one of three ways: +
.. Drag and drop the file from the *Package Explorer* pane to the input field beside *Input sample data* in the *Preview*, as shown below: +
 +
image::2_4-preview.png[2.4.preview]

.. Click the ellipsis (**...**) button to the right of the *Input sample data* field, and use the file browser to select the file.
.. Type the path of the file into the *Input sample data* input field.
. Once the file is selected, click *Run Mapping*. DataMapper generates the preview of the JSON output file: +

== Input Arguments

[TIP]
For details on Anypoint DataMapper's *Input arguments* feature, consult xref:using-input-arguments.adoc[DataMapper - Using Input Arguments].

DataMapper's *Preview* feature allows you to incorporate the _value_ of an input argument into the previewed data.

It is not possible to incorporate an input argument itself, since an input argument is a Mule expression, and *Preview* does not execute Mule expressions but only simulates their results. You must supply the result itself, as a string enclosed in double quotes.

To include the value of an input argument in a DataMapper preview, complete the following steps:

. In DataMapper's *Mappings* tab, ensure that your input argument is properly mapped to a field in the *Output* pane.

In the screenshot below, the input argument *dt* is mapped to the output field *date*: +
 +
image:2_6-preview.png[2.6.preview]
+
The input argument *dt* returns a string containing the time and date of the run. It has been configured with the following values: +
 *Name*: `dt` +
 *Type*: `string` +
 *Mule expression*: `#[string:#[function:date]`
////

. In the *Preview* tab, click *Input Arguments* next to *Run Mapping*. The *Input arguments* window pops up: +
 +
image::2_7-preview.png[2.7.preview]

. Click the empty space in the *Value* column, and type the desired value of your input argument, enclosed in double quotes. +
+
image::2_7-2-preview.png[2.7-2.preview]

. Click *OK*.
. Click *Run Mapping*.

The output of the preview should now include the "mock" value of the input argument: +
