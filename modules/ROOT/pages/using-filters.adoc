= Using Filters

Filters specify conditions that must be met for a message to be routed to a external service or continue progressing through a flow. There are several standard filters that come with Mule ESB that you can use, or you can create your own filters.

You can create a global filter and then reference it from your flows. Global filters require the "name" attribute, whereas filters configured on endpoints or routers do not.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<!-- Globally defined filter with name attribute -->
<payload-type-filter name="payloadFilter" expectedType="java.lang.String" />

<flow>
  <tcp:inbound-endpoint host="localhost" port="1234">
    <!-- Here we reference the filter defined globally using it for this endpoint -->
    <filter ref="payloadFilter"/>
  </tcp:inbound-endpoint>
  <echo-component/>
</flow>
----

For reference to the configuration of each filter, see xref:filters-configuration-reference.adoc[Filters Configuration Reference].

== Using in Flows

Filters return null if the condition is evaluated to false. Otherwise, they return the message. In the case of flows, a condition of false will halt the processing of the flow for that message. If the inbound endpoint defined on a Flow has a request-response exchange-pattern and there are no <response> blocks in your flow then the response used is simply the result from the last Message Processor in the flow, which will be null.

== Standard Filters

Mule includes the following standard filters that you can apply to your routers:

=== Payload Type Filter

Checks the class type of the payload object inside a message.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<payload-type-filter expectedType="java.lang.String"/>
----

=== Expression Filter

The expression filter evaluates the expression. If the expression's value is true, the message is let through. Otherwise, the message is discarded.

For more about expressions in Mule, see xref:mule-expression-language-mel.adoc[Mule Expression Language MEL].

=== RegEx Filter

Applies a http://www.regular-expressions.info/[regular expression] pattern to the message payload. The filter applies `toString()` to the payload, so you might also want to apply a <<Payload Type Filter>> to the message using an <<And Filter>> to make sure the payload is a String.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<regex-filter pattern="the quick brown (.*)"/>
----

=== Wildcard Filter

Applies a wildcard pattern to the message payload. The filter applies `toString()` to the payload, so you might also want to apply a <<Payload Type Filter>> to the message using an <<And Filter>> to make sure the payload is a String.

For the string "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", the following patterns would match:

* *x jumped over the lazy dog
* the quick*
* *fox*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wildcard-filter pattern="the quick brown *"/>
----

=== Exception Type Filter

A filter that matches an exception type.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<exception-type-filter expectedType="java.lang.RuntimeException"/>
----

=== Message Property Filter

This filter allows you add logic to your routers based on the value of one or more properties of a message. This filter can be very powerful because the message properties are exposed, allowing you to reference any transport-specific or user-defined property. For example, you can match one or more HTTP headers for an HTTP event, match properties in JMS and email messages, and more.

By default, the comparison is case sensitive. You can set the `caseSensitive` attribute to override this behavior.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<message-property-filter pattern="Content-Type=text/xml" caseSensitive="false"/>
----

The expression is always a key value pair. If you want to use more complex expressions, you can use the <<Logic Filters>>. The following example shows two filters :

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<and-filter>
  <message-property-filter pattern="JMSCorrelationID=1234567890"/>
  <message-property-filter pattern="JMSReplyTo=null"/>
</and-filter>
----

=== Logic Filters

There are three logic filters that can be used with other filters: And, Or, and Not. Logic filters can be nested so that more complex logic can be expressed.

==== And Filter

An And filter combines two filters and only accepts the message if it matches the criteria of *both* filters.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<and-filter>
  <payload-type-filter expectedType="java.lang.String"/>
  <regex-filter pattern="the quick brown (.*)"/>
</and-filter>
----

==== Or Filter

The Or filter considers two filters and accepts the message if it matches the criteria of *either one* of the filters.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<or-filter>
  <payload-type-filter expectedType="java.lang.String"/>
  <payload-type-filter expectedType="java.lang.StringBuffer"/>
</or-filter>
----

==== Not Filter

A Not filter accepts the message if it does *not* match the criteria in the filter.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<not-filter>
  <payload-type-filter expectedType="java.lang.String"/>
</not-filter>
----

== Transport and Module Filters

Several Mule transports and modules provide their own filters. For example, the xref:xml-module-reference.adoc[XML Module Reference] includes a filter to determine if a message is XML. For more information, see xref:transports-reference.adoc[Transports Reference] and xref:modules-reference.adoc[Modules Reference]. Also, there are filters in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange[Anypoint Exchange].

== Creating Custom Filters

The standard filters handle most filtering requirements, but you can also create your own filter. To create a filter, implement the Filter interface, which has a single method:

----
public boolean accept(MuleMessage message);
----

This method returns true if the message matches the criteria that the filter imposes. Otherwise, it returns false.

You can then use this filter with the `<custom-filter...>` element, using the `class` attribute to specify the custom filter class you created and specifying any necessary properties using the `<spring:property>` child element. For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<outbound>
  <filtering-router>
    <http:outbound-endpoint address="http://localhost:65071/services/EnterOrder?method=create" exchange-pattern="request-response"/>
      <custom-filter class="org.mule.transport.http.filters.HttpRequestWildcardFilter">
        <spring:property name="pattern" value="/services/EnterOrder?wsdl"/>
      </custom-filter>
  </filtering-router>
</outbound>
