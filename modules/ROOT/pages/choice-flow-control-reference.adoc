The Choice Flow Control, which is also known as a flow router, evaluates the payload or properties of each message it receives according to specified criteria, then determines where to route that message. Typically, two or more message processors have been designated as router targets. If more than one of these message processors meets the specified evaluation criteria, Choice routes the message to the first qualifying processor. If no message processor meets the criteria, and a message processor has been designated as the *Otherwise* option, the message is sent to that message processor.

In programming terms, using a Choice Flow Control adds the equivalent of an if/then/else code block to the flow logic. In the XML configuration file, the code for Choice relies on a `when` attribute, as the following code sample indicates:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<choice>
 <when expression="payload=='foo'" evaluator="groovy">
  <append-string-transformer message=" Hello foo" />
 </when>
 <when expression="payload=='bar'" evaluator="groovy">
  <append-string-transformer message=" Hello bar" />
 </when>
 <otherwise>
  <append-string-transformer message=" Hello ?" />
 </otherwise>
</choice>
----

You can think of a Choice Flow Control as a router that sends messages for different kinds of processing, depending on their content.

== Configuring the Choice Flow Control

Complete the following steps to configure Choice Flow Control:

. Drag the *Choice* icon from the Studio Palette to the Message Flow canvas, positioning it within the sequence of message blocks that form the flow (See: **below, left**).
. Identify two or more message processors you want to act as potential routes (i.e., targets) for the Choice router. For example, you might want to send a message to a file or log it to a database, depending on the content of that message. One at a time, drag *Logger* and *File* to the right of the Choice icon, then release them so that they form a vertical column to the right of the Choice icon (See: **below, center**).
. Double-click *Choice* to open its Pattern Properties pane (See: **below, right**). +

+
. Click the *Documentation* tab and enter relevant information about this flow control, including the expression used and the available routing options, in the *Description* field. These notes will appear in a yellow balloon that pops up when you hover your mouse over the *Choice* icon on the Message Flow canvas.
+
NOTE: The *Choice* Flow Control does not have a *Display Name* field.
+
. Click the *Choice Properties* tab to configure an evaluator and an expression for each of the routes you have specified for the *Choice* flow control (i.e, router).
. To open the Route Properties pane (See: **below, upper left**), double-click *Logger*, the first of the icons that represents a route option you specified for the Choice router. Now complete the following steps:
. Click the down button to the right of the the *Evaluator* field, and select an evaluator from the drop down list (See: **below, lower left**). Consult <<Evaluator Options of the Choice Flow Control>> for the available choices, along with brief descriptions.
. Enter an expression for evaluating the message. For example, you might enter something like:
+
[source,java]
----
expression="equals('foo') || content.endsWith('bar')"
----
+
. If you wish to designate a specific message processor as the route to be used when all other available routes fail to satisfy the expression criteria, click the check box marked *Otherwise* (See: **below, upper right**)
. Click *OK* to close the Route Properties pane.
. Repeat the previous series of steps, in turn, for each router target option in the *Choice Properties* pane.

IMPORTANT: Only one route at a time can act as the *Otherwise* option. If you check *Otherwise* for more than one route, *yes* will appear in the *Otherwise* column on the *Pattern Properties* pane for only the the last message process designated as *Otherwise* (See: **below, lower right**).
