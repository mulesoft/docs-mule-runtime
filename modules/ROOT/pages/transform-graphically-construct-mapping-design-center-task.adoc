:keywords:

Through the graphical UI of the Transform component you can do the tasks below. Each task will produce the DataWeave source code that describes the action.

== Map a Field

Drag an element on the input structure over to another on the output structure, this action creates a line that joins these two elements.

== Map a Structure

Drag a high-level structure that contains lists of elements or inner fields onto a compatible one in the output. This creates a shaded region covering all the mapped structure. Fields that have identical names in these structures are automatically mapped.

== Remove a Mapping

. Select the corresponding input element.
+
A trash can icon image:graphically-construct-mapping-design-center-task-2457b.png["Delete icon", 5%, 5%] appears on the connection.
+
. Click the trash can icon.


== Set a Fixed Value or Function


. Double click on a field (that doesn't have any children) in the output tree. This adds a function icon image:graphically-construct-mapping-design-center-task-8a822.png["Function icon", 5%, 5%] next to it.

. A box with the default value `null` appears. You can change `null` to anything you want, such as:
+

* A fixed text value by using " ".
* A reference to an input field.
* A statement that includes DataWeave functions.

This experience relates to that of using a spreadsheet, where each field can be a direct reference to another field, or can be the product of a function that involves such references.

[NOTE]
Functions can be removed by clicking on the trash-can icons that appear next to them.
