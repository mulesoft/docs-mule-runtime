While some connectors, such as xref:http-connector.adoc[HTTP] and xref:ftp-connector.adoc[FTP], utilize a polling process to actively retrieve messages from an external resource, most message processors in Mule are triggered when called by a previous element in a flow. If you want to arrange for a message processor to actively call a resource at regular intervals, use a Poll scope.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with the xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Visual Editor in Anypoint Studio] that you can use to create applications in Studio. Further, this document references xref:global-elements.adoc[Global Elements] and the category of message processors known as xref:scopes.adoc[scopes].  Review xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio Essentials] to learn more about developing with Mule ESB's graphical user interface.

== Pausing Polling During Debugging

While trying to debug an application that utilizes polling functionality, it is challenging to constantly trigger flow processing so as to monitor Mule activity. To trigger polling during testing, use the *Poll Resume* and *Poll Pause* mechanisms available with Studio's Visual Debugger.

. Run your project in Debug Mode. (Refer to the xref:5@studio::studio-visual-debugger.adoc[Visual Debugger] document for greater detail.)
. In debug mode, notice the set of buttons in the title bar of the Poll scope (see image below). Use the green **Poll Start-Pause** button to trigger the poll and initiate the flow; click again to halt polling.
+
image::poll-debug.png[poll_debug]

. While running your project in debug mode, Studio opens a new *Mule Debugger View* tab the lower section of the screen. In the top-right of this tab, Studio displays two icons which allow you to stop or start all polls in your project at the same time.
+
image::poll-startstop.png[poll_startStop]

== Polling for Updates using Watermarks

Rather than polling a resource for _all_ its data with every call, you may want to acquire only the data that has been newly created or updated since the last call. To acquire only new or updated data, you need to keep a persistent record of either the item that was last processed, or the time at which your flow last polled the resource. In the context of Mule flows, this persistent record is called a *watermark* .

Typically, Mule sets a watermark to a default value the first time the flow runs, then uses it as necessary when running a query or making an outbound request (i.e. calling a resource). Depending upon how the flow processes the results of the call, Mule may update the original value of the watermark or maintain the original value. As the value must persist across flows, Mule uses an object store for persistent storage. Built into the poll scope, object stores require no custom logic. You can configure watermarks by setting a couple of attributes.

Consider the following generic Mule flow.

image::watermark-expbasic.png[]

This flow regularly polls a resource, then performs a series of operations on the resulting payload. With every poll, the application acquires only the data that is newly created or updated since the last call to the resource. In this example, Mule stores watermarks in two variables:

* a persistent object store variable
* an exposed flow variable

[NOTE]
If you're already comfortably familiar with Mule components in general, you might find https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/mule-dev/data-synchronizing-made-easy-with-mule-watermarks/[this blog post] to be a clear explanation, as it explains the watermark by replicating its behavior with a series of other Mule components.

The diagram below illustrates same flow including numbered steps. The step-by-step explanation below describes the activities Mule performs in the background with these two variables.

image::watermark-w-selectors.png[]

.  Mule looks for a variable in the object store with a name that matches the value of the Poll attribute `"Variable Name` *`"`* . In this case the chosen name is `lastModifiedID`. +
.  If Mule finds a variable by this name, Mule exposes it by creating a flow variable (`flowVar`) with the same name. +
+
[NOTE]
The first time the poll runs, no object store variable exists by this name. In this case, Mule creates a flow variable anyway, and loads it with the value you provide in the `Default Expression` attribute. In this case, the initial value is 0.

. Mule polls the resource. Connectors inside the poll should include filters that accept the `flowVars` as an attribute, as per the code below.
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
sinceId="#[flowVars['lastModifiedID']]"
----

. Mule executes the rest of the flow. +
. When the flow has completed execution, Mule updates the value of the flowVars according to either the  *`Update Expression`* or a combination of the *`Selector Expression`* and the chosen *`Selector`* . In this case, the Selector Expression is `#[payload.id]`, and the Selector is `LAST`, so Mule will inspect the id attribute of each of the returned objects and pick the last of these as the new value for the `lastmodifiedID` flowVars.
. Mule saves the flowVars back into the object store. If no variable existed in the object store in step 1, Mule creates a new variable in the object store.
+
[TIP]
If you define a value in the optional "`Object Store`" poll attribute, Mule searches for an object store by your value instead of the default user object store.

=== List of Watermark Attributes

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Attributes |XML element |Req'd? |Default |Description
|*Variable Name* |`variable` |x |- |Identifies both the *object store key* that Mule uses to store the watermark, and the name of the *flowVars* where Mule exposes the watermark value to the user.
|*Default Expression* |`default-expression` |x |- |If Mule cannot locate the object store key it uses the default expression to generate a value. This is useful for the first run of the flow.
|*Update Expression* |`update-expression` |  |Value of the variable attribute. |Mule uses the result of this expression to update the watermark once flow execution is complete. Use this expression as an alternative to a selector in case you need to follow a more complex logic.
|*Selector* |`selector` |  |- a|
The criteria Mule will use to pick the next value for the flowVars. There are four available selectors: MIN, MAX, FIRST and LAST. +
If you use this attribute, you must also provide a value for Selector Expression.

|*Selector Expression* |`selector-expression` |  |- |Mule executes this expression on every object returned by the Poll. The Selector then collects the returned values and picks one according to the chosen criteria. +
If you use this attribute, you must also provide a value for the Selector.
|*Object Store* |`object-store-ref` |  |The default user object store. |A reference to the object store in which you wish to store the watermarks.

=== Variation For Updating the Flow Variable

As described above, the watermark element includes two ways to update the flow variable (`flowVars`) every time flow execution completes:

* set an expression in the attribute `update-expression`
* set an expression in the attribute `selector-expression`, and a criteria in `selector`

However, neither of these options support exception handling strategies; you may wish to add more complex logic rules to the process of updating the flow variable. To do so, you can use other message processors in your flow to set the flow variable using custom logic.

Add code, such as the example below, into a Java class, wrapping your extra custom logic around it.

[source,text,linenums]
----
#[flowVars['lastModifiedID']] = #[payload.id]
----

[WARNING]
If you are using custom logic to update the `flowVars`, **ensure that the radio button for `update-expression` is selected, but that the field is left empty**. If the `update-expression` attribute has a value, Mule stores new watermark information on the `flowVars` according to that attribute, overwriting any custom logic you may have defined for updating the variable.

The image below displays a sample flow which updates the flowVars using custom logic; note the empty `update-expression` attribute.

image::watermark-expcomplex.png[]

== Using Watermarks with Auto-Paging

Any connector which is enabled for xref:auto-paging-in-anypoint-connectors.adoc[auto-paging] allows you to process large data sets in separate batches. This capability mitigates for memory overload, but also imposes certain conditions when used in conjunction with watermarks. The following example illustrates the recommended method for using watermarks when polling a connector that auto-pages its response.

The main difficulty when dealing with auto-paging connectors is that collection object that they output can only be iterated through once. Selecting a watermark, such as the maximum value, would require iterating through the collection, which would consume it. Therefore, this action is not performed in the poll element, but rather when you iterate through the collection later in your flow, such as when you apply a for each element.


[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== STUDIO Visual Editor

. Place an *auto-paging-enabled* *connector* inside a *poll* scope as in the previous examples. +
+
image::ex11.png[]

. Configure the connector according to the following screenshot. Note that the query orders the output in ascending order of *LastModifiedDate* so that the last item in the list is the newest. This detail is critical.
+
image::salesforce.png[]
[WARNING]
Be sure to configure the order of the output so that the LAST element in the collection is the most recent one!
+
Configure the poll scope according to the table below. The watermark will be a variable named `lastUpdated`. When you iterate through the collection, later in your flow, Mule updates the value of the variable to the value you put in the Selector field, in this case `#[payload['lastUpdated']]`. Its default value is the result of evaluating the following expression: `#['YESTERDAY']`.
+
image::withselector.png[]
+
[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Sample XML
|*Variable Name* |The watermark will be a variable named `lastUpdated` |`variable=` `"lastUpdated"`
|*default-expression* |The default value of lastUpdated will be the result of evaluating `#['YESTERDAY']`. |`default-expression=#['YESTERDAY']`
|*Selector* |Criteria to pick which value to use, out of all of the ones in the collection |`selector="MAX"`
|*Selector Expression* |Mule updates `lastUpdated` to the Maximum value in the collection of `#[payload['lastUpdated']]` |`selector-expression=#[payload['lastUpdated']]`
|===
. Next, you need to process the output of the connector with an element that can handle collections, such as a *xref:foreach.adoc[Foreach]* scope. The message processors set within the Foreach scope process each item in a collection individually, one at a time. While it iterates through the collection, it communicates with the poll scope, sending it the selector values so that the MAX can be picked.
+
[WARNING]
Keep in mind that when dealing with collections with auto-paging, you need to process the collection at some point of your flow. If you don't, the selector in your poll won't be updated.
+
image::ex12.png[]

. Inside the Foreach scope, place a Logger, set its message to `#[payload['lastUpdated]]`. It will log the time of the last update for every element in your collection.
