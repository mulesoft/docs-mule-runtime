While some connectors, such as [HTTP] and [FTP], utilize a polling process to actively retrieve messages from an external resource, most message processors in Mule are triggered when called by a previous element in a flow. If you want to arrange for a message processor to actively call a resource at regular intervals, use a Poll scope.

== Assumption

This document assumes that you are familiar with the [Visual Editor in Anypoint Studio] and that you can use to create applications in Studio. Further, this document references [Global Elements] and the category of message processors known as [scopes].  Review the [Anypoint Studio Essentials] to learn more about developing with Mule ESB's graphical user interface.

== Pausing Polling During Debugging

While trying to debug an application the utilizes polling functionality, it is challenging to constantly trigger flow processing so as to monitor Mule activity. To trigger polling during testing, use the *Poll Resume* and *Poll Pause* mechanisms available with Studio's Visual Debugger.

. Run your project in Debug Mode. (Refer to the [Visual Debugger] document for greater detail.)

. In debug mode, notice the set of buttons in the title bar of the Poll scope (see image below). Use the green *Poll Start-Pause* button to trigger the poll and initiate the flow; click again to halt polling.
+
image::poll-debug.png[poll_debug]

. While running your project in debug mode, Studio opens a new *Mule Debugger View* tab the lower section of the screen. In the top-right of this tab, Studio displays two icons which allow you to stop or start all polls in your project at the same time.
+
image::poll-startstop.png[poll_startStop]

== Polling for Updates using Watermarks

Rather than polling a resource for all its data with every call, you may want to acquire only the data that has been newly created or updated since the last call. To acquire only new or updated data, you need to keep a persistent record of either the item that was last processed, or the time at which your flow last polled the resource. In the context of Mule flows, this persistent record is called a *watermark*.

Typically, Mule sets a watermark to a default value the first time the flow runs, then uses it as necessary when running a query or making an outbound request (i.e. calling a resource). Depending upon how the flow processes the results of the call, Mule may update the original value of the watermark or maintain the original value. As the value must persist across flows, Mule uses an object store for persistent storage. Built into the poll scope, object stores require no custom logic. You can configure watermarks by setting a couple of attributes.


Consider the following generic Mule flow.

image::watermark-expbasic.png[]

This flow regularly polls a resource, then performs a series of operations on the resulting payload. With every poll, the application acquires only the data that is newly created or updated since the last call to the resource. In this example, Mule stores watermarks in two variables:

* a persistent object store variable
* an exposed flow variable

[NOTE]
If you're already comfortably familiar with Mule components in general, you might find [this blog post] to be a clear explanation, as it explains the watermark by replicating its behavior with a series of other Mule components.

The diagram below illustrates same flow including numbered steps. The step-by-step explanation below describes the activities Mule performs in the background with these two variables.

image::watermark-w-selectors.png[]

. Mule looks for a variable in the object store with a name that matches the value of the Poll attribute `"Variable Name"`. In this case the chosen name is `lastModifiedID`.

. If Mule finds a variable by this name, Mule exposes it by creating a flow variable (`flowVar`) with the same name.
+
[NOTE]
The first time the poll runs, no object store variable exists by this name. In this case, Mule creates a flow variable anyway, and loads it with the value you provide in the `Default Expression` attribute. In this case, the initial value is 0.

. Mule polls the resource. Connectors inside the poll should include filters that accept the flowVars as an attribute, as per the code below.
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
sinceId="#[flowVars['lastModifiedID']]"
----

. Mule executes the rest of the flow.

. When the flow has completed execution, Mule updates the value of the `flowVars` according to either the *Update Expression* or a combination of the *Selector Expression* and the chosen *Selector*. In this case, the Selector Expression is `#[payload.id]`, and the Selector is `LAST`, so Mule will inspect the id attribute of each of the returned objects and pick the last of these as the new value for the `lastmodifiedID` flowVars.

. Mule saves the flowVars back into the object store. If no variable existed in the object store in step 1, Mule creates a new variable in the object store.
+
[TIP]
If you define a value in the optional `"Object Store"` poll attribute, Mule searches for an object store by your value instead of the default user object store.

== List of Watermark Attributes

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attributes |XML Element |Required |Default |Description
|*Variable Name* |`variable` ^|X |- |Identifies both the *object store key* that Mule uses to store the watermark, and the name of the *flowVars* where Mule exposes the watermark value to the user.
|*Defualt Expression* |`default-expression` ^|X |- |If Mule cannot locate the object store key if uses the default expression to generate a value. This is useful for the first run of the flow.
|*Update Expression* |`update-expression` | |Value of the variable attribute |Mule uses the result of this expression to update the watermark once flow execution is complete. Use this expression as an alternative to a selector in case you need to follow a more complex logic.
|*Selector* |`selector` | |- |The criteria Mule will use to pick the next value for the `flowVars`. There are four available selectors: MIN, MAX, FIRST and LAST. If you use this attribute, you must also provide a value for Selector Expression.
|*Selector Expression* |`selector-expression` | |- |Mule executes this expression on every object returned by the Poll. The Selector then collects the returned values and picks one according to the chosen criteria. If you use this attribute, you must also provide a value for the Selector.
|*Object Store* |`object-store-ref` | |The default user object store. |A reference to the object store in which you wish to store the watermarks.

=== Variation for Updating the Flow Variable

As described above, the watermark element includes two ways to update the flow variable (flowVars) every time flow execution completes:

* set an expression in the attribute update-expression
* set an expression in the attribute selector-expression, and a criteria in selector

However, neither of these options support exception handling strategies; you may wish to add more complex logic rules to the process of updating the flow variable. To do so, you can use other message processors in your flow to set the flow variable using custom logic.

Add code, such as the example below, into a Java class, wrapping your extra custom logic around it.

[source,text,linenums]
----
#[flowVars['lastModifiedID']] = #[payload.id]
----

[WARNING]
If you are using custom logic to update the `flowVars`, *ensure that the radio button for update-expression is selected, but that the field is left empty*. If the `update-expression` attribute has a value, Mule stores new watermark information on the `flowVars` according to that attribute, overwriting any custom logic you may have defined for updating the variable.

The image below displays a sample flow which updates the flowVars using custom logic; note the empty update-expression attribute.

image::watermark-expcomplex.png[]

== Using Watermarks with Auto-Paging

Any connector which is enabled for [auto-paging] allows you to process large data sets in separate batches. This capability mitigates for memory overload, but also imposes certain conditions when used in conjunction with watermarks. The following sections illustrate two recommended methods for using watermarks when polling a connector that auto-pages its response.

=== Example 1 - Setting a Variable Inside a Foreach Scope

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Place an *auto-paging-enabled-connector* inside a *poll* scope as in previous examples.
+
image::ex11.png[]

. Configure the connector according to the following screenshot. Note that the query orders the output in ascending order of *LastModifiedDate* so that the last item in the list is the newest. The details is crucial.
+
image::salesforce.png[]
+
[WARNING]
Be sure to configure the order of the output so that the LAST element in the collection is the most recent one!

. Configure the poll scope according to the table below. The watermark will be a variable named lastUpdated. When the flow has finished processing, Mule updates the value of the variable to the value of the *flow variable* by the same name, `lastUpdated`. Its default value is the result of evaluating the following expression: `#['YESTERDAY']`.
+
image::yesterday.png[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute Name |Description |Sample XML
|*Variable Name* |The watermark will be a variable named `lastUpdated` |`variable= "lastUpdated"`
|*default-expression* |The default value of `lastUpdated` will be the result of evaluating `#['YESTERDAY']`|`#['YESTERDAY']`
|*update-expression |Mule updates `lastUpdated` to the value of the flow variable by the same name `lastUpdated` |`#[flowVars['lastUpdated']]`
|===

. Next, you need to process the output of the connector with an element that can handle collections, such as a [Foreach] scope. The message processors set within the Foreach scope process each item in a collection individually, one at a time.
+
image::ex12.png[]

. Inside the Foreach scope, place a Variable transformer. This message processor sets the value of a variable on each iteration of the Foreach scope, overwriting the variable's value each time. Since you ordered your collection so that the last element is the newest, the value that "sticks" at the end of the Foreach's iteration is what Mule needs for the watermark.
+
image::ex13.png[]

. Configure the Variable to change `lastUpdated` to the following expression: `#[payload['lastUpdated]]`
+
image::setvariable.png[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Value |Explanation
|*Name* |`lastUpdated` |The name of the variable to update.
|*Value* |`#[payload['lastUpdated']]` |The source from which to obtain the value.
|===

. Add a Logger at the end of your flow, outside the foreach scope, to log the value of `lastUpdated`. The logger also allows you to verify that the watermark works.
+
image::fullex1.png[]

[discrete.view]
=== XML Editor or Standalone

. Add a poll element to your flow, then add a *watermark variable* as a child element. The watermark will be a variable named lastUpdated. When the flow has finished processing, Mule updates the value of the variable to the value of the *flow variable* by the same name, lastUpdated. Its default value is the result of evaluating the following expression: `#['YESTERDAY']`.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<poll frequency="100000" doc:name="Poll">
            <watermark variable="nextSync" default-expression="#['YESTERDAY']" update-expression="#[flowVars['lastUpdated']]"/>
</poll>
----
+

|===
|Attribute |Description |Sample XML
|*variable* |The watermark will be a variable named `lastUpdated` |`variable= "lastUpdated"`
|*default-expression* |The default value of `lastUpdated` will be the result of evaluating `#['YESTERDAY'].` |`#['YESTERDAY']`
|*update-expression* |`lastUpdated` will be updated to the value of the flow variable by the same name, `lastUpdated` |`#[flowVars['lastUpdated']]`
|===

. Add an auto-paging-enabled connector as a child element of the poll element. Note that the query orders the output in ascending order of *LastModifiedDate* so that the last item in the list is the newest. This detail is critical.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<poll frequency="100000" doc:name="Poll">
            <watermark variable="nextSync" default-expression="#['YESTERDAY']" update-expression="#[flowVars['lastUpdated']]"/>
            <sfdc:query config-ref="" query="dsql:SELECT Email,FirstName,LastModifiedDate,LastName FROM Contact WHERE LastModifiedDate &gt; #[flowVars['nextSync']] ORDER BY LastModifiedDate ASC LIMIT 100" doc:name="Salesforce"/>
</poll>
----
+
[WARNING]
Be sure to configure the order of the output so that the LAST element in the collection is the most recent one!

. Next, you need to process the output of the connector with an element that can handle collections, such as a Foreach scope. The message processors set within the [Foreach] scope process each item in a collection individually, one at a time.

. Inside the Foreach scope, place a Variable transformer. This message processor sets the value of a variable on each iteration of the Foreach scope, overwriting the variable's value each time. Since you ordered your collection so that the last element is the newest, the value that "sticks" at the end of the Foreach's iteration is what Mule needs for the watermark. Configure the variable to change the value of lastUpdated to the value resulting from evaluating the following expression: `#[payload['lastUpdated]]`
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<foreach doc:name="For Each">
    <set-variable variableName="lastUpdated" value="#[payload['lastUpdated']]" doc:name="Variable"/>

|Attribute |Value |Explanation
|*variableName* |`lastUpdated` |The name of the variable to update.
|*value* |`#[payload['lastUpdated']]` |The source from which to obtain a value.

=== Example 2 - Setting a Variable DataMapper

[.ex]
=====
[discrete.view]
=== Studio Visual Editor

. Place an *auto-paging-enabled connector* inside a *poll* scope as in the previous examples.

. Configure the connector according to the following screenshot. Note that the query orders the output in ascending order of *LastModifiedDate* so that the last item in the list is the newest. This detail is critical.
+

+
[WARNING]
Be sure to configure the order of the output so that the LAST element in the collection is the most recent one! *ORDER BY LastModifiedDate*

. Configure the poll scope according to the table below. The watermark will be a variable named `lastSync`. When the flow has finished processing, Mule updates the value of the variable to the value of the *flow variable* by named `lastUpdated`. Its default value is the result of evaluating the following expression: `#['YESTERDAY'].`

+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute |Description |Sample XML
|*Variable Name* |The watermark will be a variable named `lastSync` |`variable= "lastSync"`
|*default-expression* |The default value of `lastSync` will be the result of `#['YESTERDAY'].` |`#['YESTERDAY']`
|*update-expression* |`lastSync` updates to the value of the flow variable `lastUpdated` |`#[flowVars['lastUpdated']]`
|===

. Next, you need to process the output of the connector with an element that can handle collections, such as a [DataMapper] transformer. DataMapper can process each item in a collection individually, one at a time.
+

. Configure the [DataMapper] so that each variable has its pairing, then add one extra output argument named *lastModified*. This output argument sets the value of a variable on each iteration of the DataMapper, overwriting it with a new value each time. Because you ordered your collection so that the last element is the newest, the value that "sticks" at the end of the DataMapper's iteration is what Mule needs for the watermark.

In other words, the value of the LastModifiedDate of the last item in the collection becomes the new value of the lastUpdated flow variable, which, in turn, Mule will use to update the value of the variable lastSync the next time the poll executes.
+

. Add a Logger at the end of your flow, outside the foreach scope, to log the value of `lastUpdated`. The logger also allows you to verify that the watermark works.
