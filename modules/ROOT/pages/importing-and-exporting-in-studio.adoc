Anypoint(TM) Studio supports the ability to import and export your projects or various project elements. The sections that follow outline the procedures to import or export information pertaining to your Studio projects. Because Studio is Eclipse-based, keep in mind that amongst the import/export options, there are ways to import or export projects that are not tailored for Mule projects, and which are not recommended for use.

== Importing Project into Studio

To import a project, select *File>Import...* Studio presents several importing options.
