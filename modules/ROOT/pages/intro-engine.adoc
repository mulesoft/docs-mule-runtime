Mule runtime engine (Mule) 4 has an improved execution engine that simplifies the development and scaling of Mule apps. The underlying engine is based on a reactive, non-blocking architecture. This task-oriented execution model allows you to take advantage of non-blocking IO calls and avoid performance problems due to incorrect processing strategy configurations.

From a development point of view, there are a few major changes:

* Exchange patterns no longer exist. All connectors receive responses. If you want to process a message asynchronously, use the Async component.
* Every flow always uses a non-blocking processing strategy, and there is no need to configure processing strategies anymore.
* There is a single, global thread pool for all flows.

== Controlling Concurrency
Mule 4 decouples thread configuration from concurrency management. To control concurrency on a flow or any component that supports it, use the `maxConcurrency` attribute to set the number of simultaneous invocations that component can receive an any given time.

<flow maxConcurrency=“1”>
  <http:listener>
  <scatter-gather maxConcurrency=“3”>
    <route/>
    <route/>
  </scatter-gather>
</flow>

== Thread Pools and Tuning apps

As mentioned above, there is now a single thread pool for all flows in an app. This decouples overall tuning from flow-specific behavior. Mule allocates threads in proportion to how many CPU cores your machine has.

Each Mule event processor can now inform Mule if it is a CPU-intensive, CPU-light, or IO-intensive operation. This helps Mule self-tune for different workloads dynamically, removing the need for you to manage thread pools manually. As a result, Mule 4 removes complex tuning requirements to achieve optimum performance.
