This page provides details on configuring the standard transformers. Note that many xref:transports-reference.adoc[transports] and xref:modules-reference.adoc[modules] provide their own transformers as well.

== Transformer

A reference to a transformer defined elsewhere.

|ref |string |yes |  |The name of the transformer to use.

== Auto transformer

A transformer that uses the transform discovery mechanism to convert the message payload. This transformer works much better when transforming custom object types rather than Java types, because there is less chance for ambiguity.

=== Attributes of <auto-transformer...>

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Identifies the transformer so that other elements can reference it. Required if the transformer is defined at the global level.
|returnClass |string |no |  |The class of the message generated by the transformer. This is used if transformers are auto-selected and to validate that the transformer returns the correct type. Note that if you need to specify an array type you need postfix the class name with '[]'. For example, if you want return a an Orange[], you set the return class to 'org.mule.tck.testmodels.fruit.Orange[]'.
|ignoreBadInput |boolean |no |  |Many transformers only accept certain classes. Such transformers are never called with inappropriate input (whatever the value of this attribute). If a transformer forms part of a chain and cannot accept the current message class, this flag controls whether the remaining part of the chain is evaluated. If true, the next transformer is called. If false the chain ends, keeping the result generated up to that point.
|encoding |string |no |  |String encoding used for transformer output.
|mimeType |string |no |  |The mime type, e.g. text/plain or application/json

A transformer that evaluates one or more expressions on the current message. Each expression equates to a parameter in the return message. The return message for two or more expressions will be an Object[].

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |no |  |Identifies the transformer so that other elements can reference it. Required if the transformer is defined at the global level.
|returnClass |string |no |  |The class of the message generated by the transformer. This is used if transformers are auto-selected and to validate that the transformer returns the correct type. Note that if you need to specify an array type you need postfix the class name with '[]'. For example, if you want return a an Orange[], you set the return class to 'org.mule.tck.testmodels.fruit.Orange[]'.
|ignoreBadInput |boolean |no |  |Many transformers only accept certain classes. Such transformers are never called with inappropriate input (whatever the value of this attribute). If a transformer forms part of a chain and cannot accept the current message class, this flag controls whether the remaining part of the chain is evaluated. If true, the next transformer is called. If false the chain ends, keeping the result generated up to that point.
|encoding |string |no |  |String encoding used for transformer output.
|mimeType |string |no |  |The mime type, e.g. text/plain or application/json
|returnSourceIfNull |boolean |no |  |If all expressions return null on this transformer, this flag will cause the source payload to be returned without modification.
|evaluator |standardExpressionEvaluators |no |  |The expression evaluator to use. Expression evaluators must be registered with the ExpressionEvaluatorManager before they can be used. Using the custom evaluator allows you to define your own evaluator with the 'custom-evaluator' attribute. Note that some evaluators such as xpath, groovy, and bean are loaded from other Mule modules (XML and Scripting, respectively). These modules must be on your classpath before the evaluator can be used.
|expression |string |no |  |The expression to evaluate. The syntax of this attribute changes depending on the evaluator being used.
|custom-evaluator |name (no spaces) |no |  |The name of the custom evaluator to use. This attribute is only used when the 'evaluator' attribute is set to "custom". You can plug in your own expression evaluators by registering them with the ExpressionEvaluatorManager.
