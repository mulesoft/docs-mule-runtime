== Prerequesites

To successfully deploy your Mule app to Runtime Fabric, consider the following requirement:

* The application must be published in Exchange. +
You can do this from Studio following the instructions  xref:studio::export-to-exchange-task.adoc[here]. +
Or you can use the Mule Maven Plugin following the instructions xref:exchange::to-publish-assets-maven.adoc[here].

== Deploying to Runtime Fabric

. Make sure you added the Mule Maven Plugin to your pom.xml file.
. Inside the plugin you element, add a configuration for your Runtime Fabric deployment as shown below:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
  ...
    <configuration>
        <runtimeFabricDeployment>
            <uri>https://anypoint.mulesoft.com</uri>
            <muleVersion>${mule.version}</muleVersion>
            <username>${username}</username>
            <password>${password}</password>
            <applicationName>${runtime.fabric.application.name}</applicationName>
            <environment>${environment}</environment>
            <provider>${provider}</provider>
            <properties>
                <key>value</key>
            </properties>
            <deploymentSettings>
                <cpuReserved>500m</cpuReserved>
                <memoryReserved>800Mi</memoryReserved>
            </deploymentSettings>
        </runtimeFabricDeployment>
    </configuration>

</plugin>

The example is using placeholder values. Configure each value with your own Runtime Fabric information.
. From the command line in your project's folder, package the application and run the deploy goal:
+
[source,bash,linenums]
