= Publishing a SOAP API
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]
:keywords: cxf

[NOTE]
When sending requests to an external web service, the recommended approach is to use the xref:web-service-consumer.adoc[Web Service Consumer]﻿ rather than the CXF Module.

The *CXF Component* facilitates the publication of **SOAP APIs **within a Mule flow.

Mule leverages Apache's open-source http://cxf.apache.org/docs/a-simple-jax-ws-service.html[CXF framework] to build APIs. You can create a CXF API in Studio by configuring a CXF component in your Mule flow to perform any of the following CXF operations related to publishing a SOAP API:

* publish a simple service
* publish a JAX-WS service
* proxy a published service

Using Mule's CXF Component, you can also xref:securing-a-soap-api.adoc[enable WS-security], specify databindings, and add interceptors to your CXF API. For more information about how Mule leverages the CXF framework, consult the xref:cxf-module-reference.adoc[CXF Module Configuration Reference].



== Assumptions

This document describes the details of the example within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule ESB’s graphical user interface (GUI). Where appropriate, the XML configuration accompanies the Studio interface screenshots. This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule ESB and the xref:5@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio interface].

== Basic Anatomy

Exposing a SOAP API through a Mule application always requires a minimum of three elements:

. an *endpoint* that receives requests and sends responses
. a *CXF Component* that references and exposes the WSDL file
. a *component* (or more likely a combination of components) that performs the operations the API supports (retrieving data, updating data in a database, etc.)

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Element |Description
|*Endpoint* |The endpoint receives requests and sends responses, both containing XML SOAP envelopes. Typically, the endpoint is HTTP, HTTPS, JMS, or VM.
|*CXF component* a|
A SOAP API needs to expose its contract through a WSDL file. Access the contents of this file by adding `?wsdl` to the API's URL when performing a request.

Through CXF, Mule allows you to present this WSDL contract using one of two https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service#Automated_design_methods[methods]:

. **WSDL-first**: start with a WSDL file that you created yourself, import it into your Mule project, then reference its location from the CXF component.
. **Code-first**: start with an annotated Java class, then have JAX-WS compile a WSDL file based upon it.

Regardless of which method you use, you can instruct the CXF component to verify the validity of incoming requests against the WSDL.

The CXF component also allows you to select an operation type:

. *Proxy Service*: Allows you to deal with XML directly in your flow. As it implies less transformations, it's more efficient in terms of response time. Use it when: +
* You want to edit the XML directly
* Are using XSLT
* You will use DataMapper to map fields +
 +
. **JAX-WS**: Converts the payload into a POJO. Attributes in the POJO are easier to access in your flow. Use it when:
* You are more comfortable working with Java objects
* You need to construct POJO or JSON outputs
* You are using Community runtime and can't employ DataMapper
* Want to present the WSDL through a Code-first approach (the proxy service only uses WSDL-first)

image::cxf-1.png[CXF-1]

image::cxf-2.png[CXF-2]

The third option, *Simple service*, can be used if you are using a simple service pattern, but is not covered here.

|*Processing Component(s)* |With the other two components in place, your flow is ready to process requests and perform the business logic that makes up your API. Your API could potentially fit into a single Java class, but will more likely include the use of several elements, such as flow controls, transformers, HTTP calls to Web services, etc.

== Building a WSDL-First Proxy Service API

This process assumes that you have already created the WSDL you intend to use for your SOAP API. For the purpose of exploring this functionality, you can use a link:{attachmentsdir}/tshirt.wsdl.xml[sample WSDL file].

. Import a WSDL file into your project. +
.. Select *File >* *Import*.
.. Select **General > File System**.
.. Select the WSDL file from your file system, then, in the *Into Folder* field, select `src/main/resources`.
.. Click *Finish*.
. Drag and drop an HTTP listener and a CXF component into a new flow on your canvas. +

+
image::basic-flow.png[basic+flow]
+
+
+

. In the HTTP Listener's properties, create a new configuration element for it. Let the port stay as the default value **8081**, and set the host to *localhost*.
. Configure the CXF component as per the image and table below.

+

The output of this component is a byte array who's content depends upon the value you set in the *Payload* field.
+
* If you select *envelope*, then the message remains wrapped within the envelope in which it was originally received
* If you selected *body*, then the message contains only the body, without its envelope
. Configure the CXF component's *Advanced* settings as per the image and table below. (Read more about Advanced Settings of the CXF Component.)

|===
+

. Drop a Flow Reference after your CXF component. This reference will redirect the requests to another flow, where the actual business logic of your API will be carried out. Keep in mind that whatever happens in this second flow, the returned output must match the output declared by the WSDL.

+
image::basic-flow2.png[basic+flow2]
+

As stated earlier, rather than fitting into a single Java class, your API's business logic may involve the use of several elements, such as flow controls, transformers, HTTP calls to Web services, etc. Where this is the case, you do not need to include a Java class; you can model, then configure your flow to perform the operations your SOAP API must support.

. Create a new flow and configure the Flow Reference component so that the *Flow Name* matches the name of this new flow. Then use other mule components to build your business logic inside this flow.
. If you want direct access to the payload in your business logic flow, you must pass the message through an **XML-to-DOM transformer**.  +

+
image::basic-flow3.png[basic+flow3]
+
Otherwise, you can use Xpath expressions to parse parts of the payload when needed. For example, suppose that you only want to alter the message when a condition is met, you can implement a choice router that evaluates the condition based on an Xpath expression.
. Run your Mule project. Access the API by sending requests to the HTTP listener. Include a SOAP envelope in the body.

[TIP]
====
To make SOAP requests to send to your SOAP API, use a free service such as http://www.soapui.org/[SoapUI] which automatically provides the SOAP message structure you need for each kind of request to the API.

Alternatively, you can use a browser extension such as Postman (Google Chrome), or the http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] command line utility to send SOAP requests. To use these, you must know the required structure of the requests.

. Create a `flow-ref` after your CXF component. This reference will redirect the requests to another flow, where the actual business logic of your API will be carried out. Keep in mind that whatever happens in this second flow, the returned output must match the output declared by the WSDL. +

As stated earlier, rather than fitting into a single Java class, your API's business logic may involve the use of several elements, such as flow controls, transformers, HTTP calls to Web services, etc. Through these elements, you can model, then configure your flow to perform the operations your SOAP API must support.

<flow name="business-logic_flow" doc:name="business-logic_flow">
         <!-- your business logic here -->
    </flow>
----

. Create a new flow and name it with the value you assigned to the `flow-ref` attribute *Flow Name*. Then use other mule components to build your business logic inside this flow.
. Run your Mule project. Access the API by sending requests to the HTTP Listener. Include a SOAP envelope in the body.

[TIP]
====
To make SOAP requests to send to your SOAP API, use a free service such as http://www.soapui.org/[SoapUI] which automatically provides the SOAP message structure you need for each kind of request to the API.

Alternatively, you can use a browser extension such as Postman (Google Chrome), or the http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] command line utility to send SOAP requests. To use these, you must know the required structure of the requests.

[NOTE]
====
For this code to be executable, you must include, in your project:

* a Java class that constructs a WSDL
* your unique business logic in the business logic flow

=== Advanced Examples

Download the following Studio project and then import it as a **Mule Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)**:

+
link:{attachmentsdir}/tshirt-service.zip[T-Shirt SOAP Service Project]

[NOTE]
Note that for the example to be deployable, you must add your own Kissmetrics API key in kissmetrics.properties and your own database reference and credentials in postgresql.properties. Without these, you can still examine the flow to get an idea of best practices.

For a different example, create a *Mule Example Project* in Studio and select the template *Service Orchestration and Choice Routing*.

Notice in these examples how the routing is being performed for different operations. Also notice how exceptions are being handled.

== Adding Security

*_Enterprise_* +
To protect the SOAP API in your Mule flow, you can configure elements in the CXF component to apply WS-security. You can add http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-security.html[WS-Security] *Configuration Elements* (i.e. key-value pairs) to validate and/or authenticate information in the SOAP header of a message; you can also enable one or more of six *Token Validators* to ensure message security. The ability to add these security features is available only in the Enterprise version of Mule.

Consult the xref:securing-a-soap-api.adoc[Securing a SOAP API] document to configure the security elements of your API.
