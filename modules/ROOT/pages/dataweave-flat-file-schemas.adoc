DataWeave can process several different types of data. For most of these types, you can import a schema that describes the input structure in order to have access to valuable metadata at design time.

DataWeave uses a YAML format called FFD (for Flat File Definition) to represent flat file schemas. The FFD format is flexible enough to support a range of use cases, but is based around the concepts of elements, composites, segments, groups, and structures.

Schemas must be written in Flat File Schema Language, and by convention use a `.ffs` extension. This language is very similar to EDI Schema Language (ESL), which is also accepted by Anypoint Studio.

In DataWeave, you can bind your input or output to a flat file schema through a property.

Note that if you intend to use a simple fixed-width format, you can set up your data type directly through the Transform component using the `Fixed Width` type. Creating an instance of this type in Studio will automatically generate a matching schema definition.

== Types of Components in a Schema

Here are the different types of components that make up a flat file schema, going from the most elementary to the more complex. Elements and Segments are always required, while Composites, Groups, and Structures might be needed depending on the <<top_level_structure, top-level structure of your document>>.

* Element - An element is a basic data item, which has an associated type and fixed width, along with formatting options for how the data value is read and written.
* Composite - (Optional) A group of elements. It can also include other child composites.
* Segment - A line of data, or record, made up of any number of elements and/or composites that might be repeated.
* Group - (Optional) Several segments grouped together. It can also include other child groups.
* Structure - A hierarchical organization of segments, which requires that the segments have unique identifier codes as part of their data.

[[top_level_structure]]
== Top-level structure of an FFD Document

The top-level definition in an FFD document starts with the form of the schema. In this case it must always be "FLATFILE", "COPYBOOK", or "FIXEDWIDTH". The differences between these forms are minor and mostly relate to how they are handled in Studio. The rest depends on the form of definitions present in the file, with the following alternatives:

* Single segment - Segment information directly at the top level (including a `values` key giving the element and/or composite details of the segment).

* Multiple segments - A `segments` key with multiple child objects, each defining one segment.

* Multiple structures - A `structures` key with multiple child objects, each defining one structure.

=== Single Segment

If you are only working with one type of record, you only need to have a segment definition for that record type in your FFD.

image::dataweave-flat-file-schemas-22788.png[]

This is a simple schema with only one segment:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
form: FLATFILE
id: 'RQH'
tag: '1'
name: Request Header Record
values:
- { name: 'Organization Code', type: String, length: 10 }
- { name: 'File Creation Date', type: Date, length: 8 }
- { name: 'File Creation Time', type: Time, length: 4 }
----

The example above simply defines a list of elements within a single segment. It has no composites to group them into.

Here is another example:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
form: FIXEDWIDTH
name: my-flat-file
values:
- { name: 'Row-id', type: String, length: 2 }
- { name: 'Total', type: Decimal, length: 11 }
- { name: 'Module', type: String, length: 8 }
- { name: 'Cost', type: Decimal, length: 8, format: { implicit: 2 } }
- { name: 'Program-id', type: String, length: 8 }
- { name: 'user-id', type: String, length: 8 }
- { name: 'return-sign', type: String, length: 1' }
----

Note that simplified forms are only for convenience. You can use the `segments` key even if you only have a single child segment definition.

=== Multiple Segments

If you are working with multiple types of records in the same transformation, you need to use a structure definition that controls how these different records are combined.

image::dataweave-flat-file-schemas-680c6.png[]

In most cases, you need to define a way to distinguish between the different types of records. You do this by identifying `tagValue` fields as part of the record definitions. The parser will check the content of the fields of each record to identify the record type, then see how it fits into the defined structure.

This is an example of a complete structure schema with several component record types:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
form: FIXEDWIDTH
structures:
- id: 'BatchReq'
  name: Batch Request
  data:
  - { idRef: 'RQH' }
  - groupId: 'Batch'
    count: '>1'
    items:
    - { idRef: 'BCH' }
    - { idRef: 'TDR', count: '>1' }
    - { idRef: 'BCF' }
  - { idRef: 'RQF' }
segments:
- id: 'RQH'
  ...
----

Note that this example is not complete. It needs to define each of the referenced segments at the end. See <<referenced_vs_inlined_defs, Referenced versus Inlined Definitions>> to understand how these segments are being referenced in this example.

=== Multiple Structures

If you have multiple structures or segment definitions in an FFD, when you apply your schema to an metadata description on a Transform component, you need to specify which one you want to use.

image::dataweave-flat-file-schemas-4e1eb.png[]

A top-level structure of a schema with multiple structures might look like this:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
form: FIXEDWIDTH
structures:
- id: 'BatchReq'
  name: Batch Request
  data:
  - { idRef: 'RQH' }
  - groupId: 'Batch'
    usage: O
    count: '>1'
    items:
    - { idRef: 'BCH' }
    - { idRef: 'TDR', count: '>1' }
    - { idRef: 'BCF' }
  - { idRef: 'RQF' }
- id: 'BatchRsp'
  name: Batch Response
  data:
  - { idRef: 'RSH' }
  - groupId: 'Batch'
    usage: O
    count: '>1'
    items:
    - { idRef: 'BCH' }
    - { idRef: 'TDR', count: '>1' }
    - { idRef: 'BCF' }
  - { idRef: 'RSF' }
segments:
- id: 'RQH'
  ...
----

The example defines two different structures, the `BatchReq` structure and the `BatchRsp` structure. Each of these structures uses a particular sequence of segments and groups of segments. The group `Batch` is repeated in both structures. A Batch group is composed of a single BCH line, multiple TDR lines, and a single BCF line.

Note that this example is not complete. It needs to define each of the referenced segments at the end. See <<referenced_vs_inlined_defs, Referenced versus Inlined Definitions>> to understand how these segments are referenced in this example.

== Element Definitions

Element definitions are the basic building blocks of application data, consisting of basic key-value pairs for standard characteristics. Flat file schemas generally use inline element definitions, where each element is defined at the point it is used within a segment or composite structure, but you can also define elements separately and reference them as needed. Here are several element definitions defined for use by reference:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
  - { id: 'OrgCode', name: 'Organization Code', type: String, length: 10 }
  - { id: 'CreatDate', name: 'File Creation Date', type: Date, length: 8 }
  - { id: 'CreatTime', name: 'File Creation Time', type: Time, length: 4 }
  - { id: 'BatchTransCount', name: 'Batch Transaction Count', type: Integer, format: { justify: zeroes }, length: 6 }
  - { id: 'BatchTransAmount', name: 'Batch Transaction Amount', type: Integer, format: { justify: zeroes }, length: 10 }
----

The supplied `id` value is used as the `idRef` value when referencing one of these definitions as part of a segment or composite. Note that if you are defining elements inline within a segment definition (as opposed to defining them at the end of the document and referencing them), the `id` field is not required.

Element definitions might have the following attributes, classified by Form as applying to inline definitions, referenced definitions (as in the above example), or references to definitions:

.Attributes
[%header,cols="3*"]
|===
|Name |Description |Form
|`count` |Number of occurrences (optional, default is `1`) |Inline or reference
|`id` |Element identifier |Referenced definition
|`idRef` |Element identifier |Reference
|`name` |Element name (optional) |All
|`type` |Value type code, as listed below |Inline, or referenced definition
|`format` |Type-specific formatting information |Inline, or referenced definition
|`length` |Number of character positions for value |Inline, or referenced definition
|`tagValue` |Value for this element used to identify a segment (see <<full_schema_ex, the Full Schema Example>>) |Inline, or referenced definition
|===

The allowed types for defining an element are:

.Types
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|Boolean |Boolean value
|Date |Unzoned date value with year, month, and day components (which might not all be shown in text form)
|DateTime |Unzoned date/time value with year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond components (which might not all be shown in text form)
|Decimal |Decimal number value, which might or might not include an explicit decimal point in text form
|Integer |Integer number value
|Packed |Packed decimal representation of a decimal number value
|String |String value
|Time |Unzoned time value with hour, minute, second, and millisecond components (which might not all be shown in text form)
|Zoned |Zoned decimal (Cobol format)
|===

////
Binary values not in Mule 4.1
|Binary |Binary value (length is the number of bytes used, 2, 4, or 8)
////

Value types support a range of format options that affect the text form of the values. These are the main options, along with the types to which they apply:

.Format Options
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Key |Description |Applies to
|implicit |Implicit number of decimal digits (used for fixed-point values with no decimal in text form) |Decimal, Packed, Zoned
|justify |Justification in field (LEFT, RIGHT, NONE, or ZEROES, the last only for numbers) |All except Packed
|pattern |For numeric values, the `java.text.DecimalFormat` pattern for parsing and writing. For date/time values, the `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` pattern. |Date, DateTime, Decimal, Integer, Time
|sign |Sign usage for numeric values (UNSIGNED, NEGATIVE_ONLY, OPTIONAL, ALWAYS_LEFT, ALWAYS_RIGHT) |Decimal, Integer, Zoned
|signed |Signed versus unsigned flag |Packed
|===

////
Binary values not in Mule 4.1
|digits |Number of digits allowed |Binary
|justify |Justification in field (LEFT, RIGHT, NONE, or ZEROES, the last only for numbers) |All except Binary and Packed
|signed |Signed versus unsigned flag |Binary, Packed
////


== Composite Definitions

Composites serve to reference a list of elements that are typically presented together. For example, `firstName` and `lastName` can be bundled together into a single composite because they are likely to be referred to as a group. Grouping elements into a composite also allows the list to be repeated.

Composite definitions are very similar to segment definitions, composed of some key-value pairs for standard characteristics along with lists of values. Composites might include both references to elements or other nested composites and inlined definitions. This is a example of a composite definition:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
- id: 'DateTime'
  name: 'Date/Time pair'
  values:
   - { name: 'File Creation Date', type: Date, length: 8 }
   - { name: 'File Creation Time', type: Time, length: 4 }
----

Composite definitions might have the following attributes:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description |Form
|`controlVal` |Value from containing level giving actual number of occurrences (only used with `count` != 1) |Inline definition, or on <<referenced_vs_inlined_defs, reference>>
|`count` |Number (or maximum number, if `controlVal` is used) of occurrences (optional, default is `1`) |Inline definition, or on <<referenced_vs_inlined_defs, reference>>
|`id` |Composite identifier for references |<<referenced_vs_inlined_defs, Referenced definition>>
|`name` |Composite name (optional) |Inline or <<referenced_vs_inlined_defs, referenced definition>>
|`values` |List of elements and composites within the composite |Inline or <<referenced_vs_inlined_defs, referenced definition>>
|===

The values list takes the same form as the values list in a segment definition.

[[segment_definitions]]
== Segment Definitions

A segment describes a type of record in your data. Segments are mainly composed of references or direct definitions of elements and composites, together with some key-value pairs that describe the segment. In a somewhat complex schema, you might have a structure that contains two different segments, where one of these describes the fields that go in the single header of a bill of materials (such as date and person), while the other segment describes the recurring fields that go into each of the actual items in the bill of materials.

This is a sample segment definition that includes one simple element and a composite with two elements within:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
- id: 'RQH'
  name: Request Header Record
  values:
   - { name: 'Organization Code', type: String, length: 10 }
   - id: 'DateTime'
     name: 'Date/Time pair'
     values:
      - { name: 'File Creation Date', type: Date, length: 8 }
      - { name: 'File Creation Time', type: Time, length: 4 }
----

Segment definitions might include the following attributes:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Section |Description
|`id` |Segment identifier (unused for inline definitions, required for <<referenced_vs_inlined_defs, referenced definitions>>)
|`name` |Segment name (optional)
|`values` |List of elements and composites within the segment (either inlined, or <<referenced_vs_inlined_defs, references>>)
|===


[[structure_definitions]]
== Structure Definitions

Structure definitions are composed of a list of references to segments and group definitions, as well as a set of key-value pairs for standard characteristics. Segments may be further organized into groups consisting of a potentially repeated sequence of segments.

Here's a sample structure definition again:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
form: FIXEDWIDTH
structures:
- id: 'BatchReq'
  name: Batch Request
  data:
  - { idRef: 'RQH' }
  - groupId: 'Batch'
    count: '>1'
    items:
    - { idRef: 'BCH' }
    - { idRef: 'TDR', count: '>1' }
    - { idRef: 'BCF' }
  - { idRef: 'RQF' }
segments:
- id: 'RQH'
  ...
----

This example includes references to two segments at the top level (`RQH` and `RQF`), as well as a group definition `Batch` that includes references to other segments (`BCH`, `TDR` and `BCF`). Note that for this structure to work, each of the <<segment_definitions, referenced segments>> needs to be defined. See <<referenced_vs_inlined_defs, Referenced versus Inlined Definitions>> to understand how segments are referenced in this example.

A structure definition can contain the following attributes:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Structure Key/Section |Description
|`id` |Structure identifier
|`name` |Structure name (optional)
|`data` |List of segments (and groups) in the structure
|===

Each item in a segment list is either a segment reference (or inline definition) or a group definition (always inline).


=== Group Definitions

A group definition can have the following attributes:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Value| Description
|`groupId` |The group identifier
|`usage` |Usage code, which might be `M` for Mandatory, `O` for Optional, or `U` for Unused (optional, defaults to `M`)
|`count` |Maximum repetition count value, which might be a number or the special value `>1`, meaning any number of repeats (optional, count value of `1` is used if not specified)
|`items` |List of segments (and potentially nested groups) making up the group
|===

[[referenced_vs_inlined_defs]]
== Referenced Versus Inlined Definitions

Besides the choice of top-level form, you also have choices when it comes to representing the components of a structure, segment, or composite. You can define the component segments, composites, and elements inline at the point of use, or you can define them in a table and reference them from anywhere. Inlining definitions is simpler and more compact, but the table form allows definitions to be reused. Table form examples must include an `id` value, and each reference to that definition uses an `idRef`. This example shows how this applies to the segments making up a structure:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
form: FIXEDWIDTH
structures:
- id: 'BatchReq'
  name: Batch Request
  data:
  - { idRef: 'RQH' }
  - { idRef: 'RQF' }
segments:
- id: 'RQH'
  name: "Request File Header Record"
  values:
  - { idref: createDate }
  - { idref: createTime }
  - { idref: fileId }
  - { idref: currency }
- id: 'RQF'
  name: "Request File Footer Record"
  values:
  - { idref: batchCount }
  - { idref: transactionCount }
  - { idref: transactionAmount }
  - { idref: debitCredit }
  - { idref: fileId }
elements:
  - { id: createDate, type: Date, length: 8 }
  - { id: createTime, type: Time, length: 4 }
  - { id: fileId, type: String, length: 10 }
  - { id: currency, type: String, length: 3 }
  - { id: batchCount, type: Integer, format: { justify: zeroes }, length: 4 }
  - { id: transactionCount, type: Integer, format: { justify: zeroes }, length: 6 }
  - { id: transactionAmount, type: Integer, format: { justify: zeroes }, length: 12 }
  - { id: debitCredit, type: String, length: 2 }
----

In the above example, the `BatchReq` structure references segments in the `data` definition section. The segments are each then defined in the `segments` section at the top level of the schema, and these in turn reference elements that are later defined in the `elements` section.

An inlined definition of the same structure looks like this:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
form: FIXEDWIDTH
structures:
- id: 'BatchReq'
  name: Batch Request
  data:
  - { idRef: 'RQH' }
  - { idRef: 'RQF' }
segments:
- id: 'RQH'
  name: "Request File Header Record"
  values:
  - { name: 'File Creation Date', type: Date, length: 8 }
  - { name: 'File Creation Time', type: Time, length: 4 }
  - { name: 'Unique File Identifier', type: String, length: 10 }
  - { name: 'Currency', type: String, length: 3 }
- id: 'RQF'
  name: "Request File Footer Record"
  values:
  - { name: 'File Batch Count', type: Integer, format: { justify: zeroes }, length: 4 }
  - { name: 'File Transaction Count', type: Integer, format: { justify: zeroes }, length: 6 }
  - { name: 'File Transaction Amount', type: Integer, format: { justify: zeroes }, length: 12 }
  - { name: 'Type', type: String, length: 2 }
  - { name: 'Unique File Identifier', type: String, length: 10 }

  - { name: 'Unique File Identifier', type: String, length: 10 }
----

This example contains a single <<structure_definitions, structure>> named 'BatchReq' with 5 components <<segment_definitions, segments>>, using a doubly-nested structure of file and batch data for the segments. Each batch contains repeating detail records. All element definitions are in-lined.

The `BatchReq` structure definition requires that the data will consist of:

* A single record that corresponds to the segment `RQH`
* One or more records that correspond to the segment `BCH`
* For each `BCH` record, one or more `TDR` records giving details of a particular transaction
* For each `BCH` record, a `BCF` record following any contained `TDR` records
* A final, single record that corresponds to the segment `RQF`

For this example every record starts with a three-character Record Type field with a specified `tagValue`. In the case of the batch records, the record type is further specified by a Batch Function `tagValue`.

This is a sample of data matching the schema example:

[source,text,linenums]

The lines in the example match the defined structure as listed below:

* 1 `RQH` (Request File Header Record) identified by the "RQH" value in the first three characters
* 2 `BCH` (Batch Header Record) identified by the "BAT" value in the first three characters combined with the 'H' character in position 10
* 3-4 `TDR` (Transaction Detail Record) identified by the "BAT" value in the first three characters combined with the 'D' character in position 10
* 5 `BCF` (Batch Footer Record) identified by the "BAT" value in the first three characters combined with the 'T' character in position 10
* 6 `BCH` (Batch Header Record) identified by the "BAT" value in the first three characters combined with the 'H' character in position 10
* 7-8 `TDR` (Transaction Detail Record) identified by the "BAT" value in the first three characters combined with the 'D' character in position 10
* 9 `BCF` (Batch Footer Record) identified by the "BAT" value in the first three characters combined with the 'T' character in position 10
* 10 `RQF` (Request File Footer Record) identified by the "RQF" value in the first three characters

`tagValue` fields provide a lot of flexibility. The above example shows using a single `tagValue` for some record types, while adding a second `tagValue` for others, but you can also use completely different fields (or even disjoint sets of fields) for a `tagValue`, as long as you provide enough details for the parser to distinguish between the different types of records.

Note that older versions of the documentation showed a different way of distinguishing records based on tag values, using `tagStart` and `tagLength` values for the structure and `tag` values for the segments. This method of distinguishing segments is much more limited than the `tagValue` approach, and is now deprecated.

== Applying a Schema as Metadata

Here's a quick step by step example of how – once you have built out your full schema – you can easily apply it to the input metadata of a Transform Message component. This example uses a flat file schema that describes a Cobol Copybook format.

. Download the sample schema file xref:{attachmentsdir}/Check.ffd[here].

. In Anypoint Studio click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project* to create a new project, give it whatever name you wish and click *Finish*.
. Drag an HTTP Connector from the palette to your empty canvas, then a *Transform Message Component*.
+
image::dataweave-flat-file-schemas-3f67f.png[]



. Click on the HTTP Connector to open its properties editor, then click the green arrow icon to create a new configuration for it. Leave all of the fields in default and click *OK*.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-a56f0.png[]

. In the *path* field write `get-copybook`. Once deployed, this will make the endpoint reachable through '+0.0.0.0:8081/get-copybook+'
. Select the *Metadata* tab and click the *Set Metadata* button.
+
image::dataweave-quickstart-702fd.png[]
. Click the *Edit* icon that appears next to the Payload element
. Click the green plus icon to add a new metadata type and name it 'my-flat-file-type'

. Select *Flat File* as the type, on the *Schema* field point it to the location of your schema file. Then click *Select* to use this Metadata type.
+
image::dataweave-flat-file-schemas-814e1.png[]

. Note that if you open the Transform Message component, the input section should show the fields that will be present in the incoming payload.
+
image::dataweave-flat-file-schemas-a677a.png[]

. Once you set up metadata for the output section (which you can do by configuring elements after the Transform Message component in the flow), you can drag and drop elements from is input structure onto the output to create a mapping.

After following the steps above, the XML of your Mule project should look like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
