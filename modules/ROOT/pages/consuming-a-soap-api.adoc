If the API that you want to consume does not already have its own Anypoint Connector, use the new *Web Service Consumer* to consume any SOAP API from within your Mule application. Access the **xref:web-service-consumer.adoc[Web Service Consumer documentation]** to learn more.

Using the information contained in the API's WSDL, this connector enables you to configure a few details to establish the connection you need for consuming a service from within your Mule application. First, identify the location of the Web service's WSDL file, then ask the Web Service Consumer to configure itself from the WSDL – host, port, address.
