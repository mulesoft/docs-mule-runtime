= Converting Maven into Studio

You may wish to leverage Studio's graphical user interface by importing a http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] project into Studio.

[WARNING]
*Important*: if you use the Maven *studio:studio* goal, you cannot use the *m2eclipse* plugin, because it will override the *studio:studio* goal. Mule Studio has built in capabilities for importing and exporting between Maven and Studio using the *studio:studio* goal, which covers most use cases.

== Importing a Maven Project into Studio

To use Studio's built-in functionality to import a Maven project, you must have a clean Maven project with no-Eclipse specific files.

. In Studio, go to *File > Import...*

. Select *Maven-based Mule Project from pom.xml*, then click *Next*

. Navigate to the location of the pom.xml file you wish to import. Mule automatically populates a Project Name, but you can adjust it.

. Be sure to select the runtime you wish to use. Check the box to *Copy project into workspace* if you want to create a copy of your project that resides in your workspace.

. Click *Finish*

Mule Studio runs the *studio:studio* goal to import the project into Studio.

== Troubleshooting

=== M2_REPO Classpath Variable Errors

If after you open you Maven project in Studio and encounter error messages (as illustrated below), you may need to set the *M2_REPO* classpath variable or, if it has already been set, re-point it to the correct repository.

. In Studio, right-click your project's name in the *Package Explorer*, then select *Properties*.

. In the *Properties* pane, click *Java Build Path* in the menu on the left, then click the *Libraries* tab.

. Click *Add Variable...*

. In the *New Variable Classpath Entry* panel, click the *Configurable Variable...* button.
+
Select the `M2-REPO` item from the list of classpath variables, then click *Edit...*
+
[NOTE]
If `M2_REPO` does not appear as an item in the list of classpath variables, click *New...* to create this classpath variable.

. Change the contents of the *Path* field to specify the location of your Maven (`m2`) repository.

. Click *OK* in each of the open panels to save your changes.

. Click the *Problems* tab in the console to confirm that the errors are no longer listed, which means they have been resolved.

=== Missing Required Repositories

If you encounter errors like this, some dependencies or artifacts cannot be resolved.

`Failed to execute goal on project schema-extractor-plugin: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.mule.tooling:schema-extractor-plugin:maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT...`

Ensure that the required plugin repositories are included in your pom file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<pluginRepositories>
        <pluginRepository>
            <id>mulesoft-release</id>
            <name>mulesoft release repository</name>
            <layout>default</layout>
            <url>http://repository.mulesoft.org/releases/</url>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </pluginRepository>
  </pluginRepositories>
