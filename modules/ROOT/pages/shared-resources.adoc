Mule can define selected connectors as common resources and expose them to all apps deployed under a same domain. These resources are known as shared resources. To host them, you must create a Mule Domain Project and then reference it from each of the projects that use the elements in it. Once defined, any Mule app associated with a particular domain can access resources in this file. Note that Mule apps can be associated with only one domain at a time.

Shared resources allow multiple development teams to work in parallel using the same set of reusable connectors. Defining these connectors as shared resources at the domain level allows the team to:

* Expose multiple services within the domain through the same port.
* Share the connection to persistent storage.
* Share services between apps through a well-defined interface.
* Ensure consistency between apps upon any changes because the configuration is only set in one place.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are using Anypoint Studio 7 with Mule runtime 4, or that you are building your apps using Studio 7 and deploying them to Mule 4 Standalone runtime.

== Limitations

Defining flows, subflows, or any message processors as shared resources is not supported. Domains are not meant to share behavior. They are meant to share resources only.

== Basic Anatomy

=== Studio Project

The following files are key within the Mule Domain Project:

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|`/src/main/mule/mule-domain-config.xml` |This is the shared resources configuration file. This file must have the `mule-domain-config.xml` file name.
|`pom.xml` |This is the dependencies file descriptor. It is a Maven POM file with required plugins for domains projects.
|`/mule-artifact.json` |This file is a descriptor for the domain artifact.
|===

=== Domain Artifact

You can find the following files when you package a domain into a JAR file:

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|`mule-domain-config.xml` |This is the shared resources configuration file. This file must have the `mule-domain-config.xml` file name.
|`/repository` |A Maven-like repository with all the dependencies of the domain.
|`/META-INF/maven/groupId/artifactId/pom.xml` |Artifact Maven descriptor file.
|`/META-INF/mule-artifact/classloader-model.json` |Internal Mule file used for dependency management.
|`/META-INF/mule-artifact/mule-artifact.json` |This file is a descriptor for the domain artifact.
|===

== Configuration

To use shared resources in your apps, you must complete the following tasks.

. <<Creating a New Domain, Create a new domain>>.
. Define one or more shared resources in that domain.
. <<Associating Applications with the Domain, Associate applications with the domain>>.
. <<Referencing Shared Resources, Reference shared resources>> in your applications.
. <<Deploying with Shared Resources, Deploy>> the domain and the applications with shared resources. Note that you can also deploy domain and apps together in a <<Deploying Domain Bundles, domain bundle>>.

The sections below describe the procedure for each of these steps.

[[create_domain_project]]
== Creating a New Domain

To create a new domain in Anypoint Studio:

. In the top menu bar select, File > New > Mule Domain Project.
+
image::new-domain.png[new+domain]
+
. Fill in the same fields as you would with a regular Mule Project:
+
image::create-new-domain.png[create+new+domain]
+
* Provide a name for the project, and select a Mule runtime version.
//NOT IN STUDIO 7, YET ANYWAY...
//* Optionally, create a `.gitignore` file if you plan to share this project through git or GitHub.


=== Defining Shared Resources

You can configure the <<create_domain_project,Domain Project>> by defining shared resources in your `mule-domain-config.xml` file. You can define multiple resources in this configuration file. In Anypoint Studio, you can edit this file in a couple of ways:

* Configuration file: Through the XML similar to the XML configuration file for a Mule app, for example:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<domain:mule-domain
        xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
        xmlns:domain="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/domain"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xmlns:doc="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/documentation"
        xsi:schemaLocation="
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
               http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/domain http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/domain/current/mule-domain-ee.xsd">

    <!-- configure here resource to be shared within the domain -->

</domain:mule-domain>
----
+
* Global Elements: This view provides a graphical interface for defining shared resources.

You can add module or connector dependencies to you domain project so you can use them as shared resources.

=== Associating Apps with the Domain in Studio

Note that apps can only be associated with one domain at a time.

To associate an existing app with a domain:

. In the Project Explorer or Package Explorer view, double-click the Mule app.
. In the menu that opens, click Properties.
. From Properties, click Mule Project.
. From the Domain field, select a domain for your project.
+
image::assign-domain.png[assign+domain]
+
Note that when you select a domain, the Server Runtime for your project will match the domain's Server Runtime automatically.

The domain will appear in the `pom.xml` for your project, for example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
      <groupId>com.mycompany</groupId>
      <artifactId>mymuledomain</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <classifier>mule-domain</classifier>
      <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

== Associating Mule Apps with a Domain (Outside Studio)

When creating a Mule app outside Studio, you need to include the `domain` property in the `mule-artifact.json` file to associate the domain your app:

`domain: <name of domain folder>`

Example:

`domain: mule-test-domain`

=== Referencing Shared Resources

In the following example, `mule-domain-config.xml`, an HTTP connector is defined as a shared resource.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::{examplesdir}/shared-resources_1.xml[]
----

Any Mule application associated with the domain can make use of the shared resource by referencing it within the configuration, just as you would reference a resource within the project itself. In the example below, the HTTP listener connector references the shared resource named `HTTP_Listener_Configuration`.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule>
   <flow name="httpService">
      <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/" doc:name="HTTP"/>
      <set-payload value="success" />
   </flow>
</mule>
----

In Studio's visual editor, you can simply pick the shared resource out of the dropdown list in the *Connector Configuration* field of the connector's properties editor:

image::pick-resource.png[pick+resource]

== Deploying with Shared Resources

In Anypoint Studio, when you deploy an application that is associated to a domain, by default Studio deploys both the application and the domain together. Also, when deploying a domain project, by default Studio deploys every application associated to it, as well. You can change these default behaviors by changing the Run Configuration for the domain. In fact, you can deploy any set of applications in your workspace together, even if they don't share the same domain.

To set this in Studio, open the drop-down menu next to the play button and select *Run Configurations*.

image::run-configurations-1.png[run+configurations+1]

Then pick the *General* tab, and tick or untick the boxes next to the projects that you want to always deploy together with the application that is currently selected on the navigation menu to the right.

image::run-configuration-3.png[run+configuration+3]

The steps below describe how to deploy your domain project and the applications outside Studio, to Standalone Mule.

. In Studio, select `File > Export`. Then in the folder named *Mule*, pick *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)*. This creates a .zip file that you can deploy to Standalone Mule.
+

[NOTE]
====
If you've created your Domain outside Studio, Zip the components of your domain project by selecting the `mule-domain-config.xml` file and, if you have one, the `lib` folder with its contents, and compressing them into a single zip file. Name this zip file with the name of the domain. Copy the zip file to `MULE_HOME/domains`.

Note that right clicking the a folder and selecting *Compress* results in additional folders being added to your folder structure when Mule unzips your file, which causes deployment problems. Use the command line to zip your files recursively, or package your app as a zip file from Studio.
====
+
. Save, zip, and copy the zip file for each application that references this domain into the `MULE_HOME/apps` folder.
. Start Mule via the command console.
+
When Mule starts, it first deploys any domains found in the `MULE_HOME/domains` folder, then it deploys the applications in the `MULE_HOME/apps` folder, so that all domains are fully started before the applications start.

=== Deploying Domain Bundles

You also have the option of bundling the applications associated with a domain in your domain folder, then deploying the entire folder as a bundled unit. To do this, include an `apps` folder in your domain folder structure and place the zip files of your applications there.

image::domainbundle.png[domainBundle]

The deployment behavior is the same as deploying a domain and apps separately: Mule first deploys the domain itself, then the applications. Deploying domain bundles simplifies the deployment mechanism for teams by removing the manual step of deploying applications separately.
