= Streaming in Mule Apps

Mule 4 introduces a new framework to work with streamed data. To understand the
changes introduced in Mule 4, it is necessary to understand how traditional
data streams are consumed:

* Data streams cannot be consumed more than once.
+
For example, consider the following flow:
+
image::streaming-about-49d23.png[]
+
.Mule 3 Streaming: Writing a File
In a Mule 3 app, this flow writes the first file correctly, while the second is
created with empty content because each component that consumes a stream expects
to receive a new stream. After the first Write operation consumes the stream,
the second Write operation receives an empty stream, so the second has no content
to write to a file.
+
Something similar happens in Mule 3 when you try to log the payload before and
after a DataWeave transformation. Consider this example:
+
.Mule 3 Streaming: Logging a Payload
image::streaming-about-5f1b3.png[]
+
This app logs the payload before the Transform Message component, but does not
log the resulting payload after Transform Message because the Logger consumes
the stream, loading it into memory. When the stream gets to the Transform Message
component, the stream content is available in memory, so it is possible
for Transform Message to consume it. After Transform Message consumes the
content, the second Logger receives an empty stream.

[[example_3]]
* Data streams cannot be consumed at the same time.
+
Consider a Mule 3 app that uses a Scatter-Gather router to split a data stream
and simultaneously log and write the payload to a file.
+
.Mule 3 Streaming: Consuming Data Streams
image::streaming-about-6af9b.png[]
+
This app fails because the streamed content cannot be processed by different
processor chains simultaneously.

== Repeatable Streams

Mule 4 introduces repeatable streams as its default framework for handling
streams. Repeatable streams enable you to:

* Read a stream more than once.
* Have concurrent access to the stream.

As a component consumes the stream, Mule saves its content into a temporary
buffer. The runtime then feeds the component from the temporary buffer, ensuring
that each component receives the full stream, regardless of how much of the
stream was already consumed by any prior component. This happens automatically
and requires no special configuration by you, which prevents the need to find
workarounds to save the stream elsewhere so you can access it again. This
configuration automatically fixes the first two Mule 3 examples outlined above.

All repeatable streams support parallel access, which means that you don't need
to worry about whether two components are trying to read the same stream when
each component is running on a different thread. Mule automatically ensures
that when component `A` reads the stream it doesn’t generate any side effects
in component `B`. This behavior enables you to perform tasks like the one
described in the <<example_3, third example>>.

== Streaming Strategies

You can configure how Mule handles streams with streaming strategies.

=== File-Stored Repeatable Stream

File storage is the default streaming strategy in Mule 4.

[NOTE]
--
File storage is only available in Mule Enterprise Edition (Mule EE).
--

This strategy initially uses an in-memory buffer size of 512 KB. For larger
streams, the strategy creates a temporary file on your disk to store
the contents, without overflowing your memory.

If you need to handle large or small files, you can change the buffer size
(`inMemorySize`) to optimize performance:

* Configuring a larger buffer size increases performance by avoiding the number
of times the runtime needs to write the buffer to your disk, but it also limits
the number of concurrent requests your application can process.
* Configuring a smaller buffer size saves memory load.

You can also set the buffer's unit of measurement (`bufferUnit`).

For example, if you know that you are going to read a file that is always
about 1 MB, you can configure a 1 MB buffer:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:read path="bigFile.json">
  <repeatable-file-store-stream
    inMemorySize="1"
    bufferUnit="MB"/>
</file:read>
----

Alternatively, if you know you are always processing a file no larger than 10 KB,
you can save memory:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:read path="smallFile.json">
  <repeatable-file-store-stream
    inMemorySize="10"
    bufferUnit="KB"/>
 </file:read>
----

Based on performance testing, the default 512 KB buffer size configuration
through this strategy does not significantly impact performance in most scenarios.
However, you need to run tests to find the proper buffer size configuration
for your needs.

=== In-Memory Repeatable Stream

The in-memory strategy is the default configuration for the Mule Kernel
(formerly called Mule Runtime Community Edition).

This strategy defaults to a buffer size of 512 KB. For larger streams, the
buffer is expanded by a default increment size of 512 KB until it reaches the
configured maximum buffer size. If the stream exceeds this limit, the
application fails.

You can customize this behavior by setting the initial size of the buffer
(`initialBufferSize`), the rate at which the buffer increases
(`bufferSizeIncrement`), the maximum buffer size (`maxinMemorySize`), and the
unit of measurement for the buffer size value (`bufferUnit`).

For example, these settings configure an in-memory repeatable stream with a
512 KB initial size, which grows at a rate of 256 KB and allows up to 2000 KB
(2 MB) of content in memory:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<file:read path="exampleFile.json">
  <repeatable-in-memory-stream
    initialBufferSize="512"
    bufferSizeIncrement="256"
    maxinMemorySize="2000"
    bufferUnit="KB"/>
 </file:read>
----

Based on performance testing, the default 512 KB buffer size, and the 512 KB
increment size configuration of this strategy does not significantly impact
performance in most scenarios. However, you need to run tests and find the
proper buffer size and size increment configuration for your needs.

=== Non-Repeatable Stream

The non-repeatable strategy disables repeatable streams, which enables you
to read an input stream only once when your use case does not require the extra
memory or performance overhead that comes with repeatable stream. Because the
stream is not saved to memory, the non-repeatable strategy performs better than
the others.

.Non-Repeatable Strategy for Streaming:
[source,xml,linenums]
----

<file:read path="exampleFile.json">
  <non-repeatable-stream />
</file:read>

----

A non-repeatable strategy enables your flows to fail promptly if a component in
the configuration tries to access a large input stream before the streaming
component executes.


Every component in Mule 4 that returns an `InputStream` or a `Streamable`
collection supports repeatable streams. These components include:

* File connector
* FTP connector
* Database connector
* HTTP connector
* Sockets connector
* SalesForce connector

== Streaming Objects

When an Anypoint Connector is configured to use auto-paging, Mule 4
automatically handles the paged output of the connector using a
repeatable auto-paging framework. This framework is similar to repeatable
streams because the connector receives the object, and Mule sets a configurable
in-memory buffer to save the object. However, while repeatable streams measure
the buffer size in byte measurements, the runtime measures the buffer size using
instance counts when handling objects.

[IMPORTANT]
When streaming objects, the in-memory buffer size is measured in instance counts.

When calculating the in-memory buffer size for repeatable auto-paging, you need
to estimate the amount of memory each instance takes to avoid running out
of memory.

As with repeatable streams, you can use different strategies to configure how
Mule handles the repeatable auto paging.

=== Repeatable File Store (Iterable)

This configuration is the default for Mule Enterprise Edition. This strategy
uses a default configured in-memory buffer of 500 objects. If your query
returns more results than the buffer size, Mule serializes those objects and
writes them to your disk. You can configure the number of objects Mule stores
in the in-memory buffer. The more objects you save in-memory, the better
performance you get from avoiding writes to disk.

For example, you can set a buffer size of 100 objects in-memory for a query from
the SalesForce Connector:

.Repeatable File Store (Iterable):
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sfdc:query query="dsql:...">
  <ee:repeatable-file-store-iterable inMemoryObjects="100"/>
</sfdc:query>
----

Note that MuleSoft uses the Kryo framework for serialization because standard
Java serialization requires the serialized object (and all its referenced objects)
to implement the `Serializable` interface. The Kryo serializer, which does not
have this limitation, is capable of serializing some things that standard Java
serialization cannot. However, Kryo cannot serialize everything. For example,
instances of `org.apache.xerces.jaxp.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendarImpl` are not
serializable, even through Kryo. MuleSoft recommends keeping your objects simple.

[NOTE]

This option is only available on Mule EE.

=== Repeatable In-Memory (Iterable)

This configuration, which is the default for the Mule Kernel, configures a default
buffer size of 500 Objects. If the query result is larger than that, the buffer
expands to a default increment size of 100 objects until it reaches the
configured maximum buffer size. If the stream exceeds this limit, the app fails.
You can customize the initial size of the buffer (`initialBufferSize`), the rate
at which the buffer increases (`bufferSizeIncrement`), and the maximum buffer
size (`maxBufferSize`).

For example, this configuration sets an in-memory buffer of 100 objects that
increments at 100 objects per increment and allows a maximum buffer size of
500 objects.

.Repeatable In-Memory (Iterable):
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sfdc:query query="dsql:...">
  <repeatable-in-memory-iterable
    initialBufferSize="100"
    bufferSizeIncrement="100"
    maxBufferSize="500" />
 </sfdc:query>
----
