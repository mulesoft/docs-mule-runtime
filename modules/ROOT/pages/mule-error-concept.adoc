Mule execution failures result in a Mule Error. Each Mule Error has the following components:

[%header,cols=“10%,60%,30%”]
|===
|Component| Description| Expression

|Description
|A description regarding the problem
|`#[error.description]`

|Type
|A type, used to characterize the problem and allow routing within an error handler
|`#[error.errorType]`

|Cause
|The underlying Java Throwable that resulted in the failure
|`#[error.cause]`

|Message
|An optional Mule Message regarding the problem
|`#[error.errorMessage]`

|Child Errors
|An optional collection of inner errors, used by elements like Scatter-Gather to provide aggregated route errors.
|`#[error.childErrors]`
|===

Each component in a Mule application declares the type of errors it throws so it's easy for you to identify potential errors when designing a Mule flow.

For example, when an HTTP request fails with a 401 status code, the Mule Error looks like this:

----
Description: HTTP GET on resource ‘http://localhost:36682/testPath’ failed: unauthorized (401)
Type: HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED
Cause: a ResponseValidatorTypedException instance
Error Message:  { "message" : "Could not authorize the user." }

== About Error Types

In the example above, the error type is `HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED`, not simply `UNAUTHORIZED`. +
Error types consist of both a namespace and an identifier, allowing you to distinguish the types according to their domain.
For example, there are `HTTP:NOT_FOUND` and `FILE:NOT_FOUND` error types. +
While connectors define their own namespace, core runtime errors have the implicit `MULE` one. +
So `MULE:EXPRESSION` and `EXPRESSION` are interpreted as one.

Another important characteristic of error types is that they may have a parent type. For example, `HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED` has `MULE:CLIENT_SECURITY` as the parent, which, in turn, has `MULE:SECURITY` as the parent. This establishes error types as specifications of more global ones: an HTTP unauthorized error is a type of client security error, which is a type of a more broad security issue.

These hierarchies allow routing to be more general. For example, a handler for `MULE:SECURITY` catches HTTP unauthorized errors as well as OAuth errors. +
Below you can see what the core runtime’s hierarchy looks like:

image::error-hierarchy.png[Error Hierarchy]

All errors are either general or `CRITICAL`, the latter being so severe that they cannot be handled and will only be logged. At the top of the general hierarchy is `ANY`, which allows for matching all types under it. It’s important to note the `UNKNOWN` type, which is used when no clear reason for the failure is found. This error can only be handled through the `ANY` type to allow for specification of unclear errors in the future, without changing the existing behavior of the app.

When it comes to connectors, each connector defines its error type hierarchy considering the core runtime hierarchy, though `CONNECTIVITY` and `RETRY_EXHAUSTED` types are always present since they are common to all connectors.

Below is listed a full list of Error Types:

* `ANY`: Error type that matches all error types that may occur in an Flow and can be handled. This does not include errors that may occur on the source. 
** `TRANSFORMATION`: indicates an error ocurred while transforming a value. This involves Mule Runtime internal transformations and not DataWeave transformations. 
** `EXPRESSION`: indicates an error ocurred while evaluating an expression.
** `VALIDATION`: indicates a validation error occured.
*** `DUPLICATE_MESSAGE`: indicates a validation error regarding a message being processed twice. For example, using the xref:idempotent-message-validator.adoc[Idempotent message validator].
** `REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED`: indicates that max attemps to reprocess a message from a source has been exhausted.
** `CONNECTIVITY`: indicates that there was a problem establishing a connection. This could occur while using a connector, for example an HTTP requester. 
*** `RETRY_EXHAUSTED`: indicates that retries of a certain execution block have been exhausted. For example, for a given operation, or using xref:until-successful-scope.adoc[Until Successful Scope].
** `ROUTING`: indicates an error occured while routing a message. For example, using the xref:round-robin.adoc[Round Robin router].
*** `COMPOSITE_ROUTING`: indicates that one or more errors occured during routing a message. For example, using a xref:scatter-gather-concept.adoc[Scatter Gather Router].
** `SECURITY`: indicates a security error ocurred, like invalid credentials being received or an expired token being used. 
*** `CLIENT_SECURITY`: indicates an external entity (e.g. calling an external endpoint) produced a security error.
*** `SERVER_SECURITY`: indicates a security error enforced by the Mule Runtime. 
**** `NOT_PERMITTED`: indicates a security restriction enforced by a filter. For example, using xref:connectors::spring/spring-module.adoc#_to_validate_authentication_using_the_spring_authorization_filter[the Authorization Filter of the Mule Spring Module].
** `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED`: indicates the maximum size allowed for a stream has been exceeded. For more insight, see xref:streaming-about.adoc[Streaming in Mule Apps].
** `TIMEOUT`: indicates timeout ocurred while processing a message. 
** `UNKNOWN`: indicates an unknown or unexpected error ocurred. This cannot be handled directly, only by handling `ANY`, to ensure backwards compatibility in case more error types are added in future runtime versions. 
* `SOURCE`: indicates that an error ocurred in the source of the flow.
** `SOURCE_ERROR_RESPONSE_GENERATE`: indicates that an error ocurred in the source of the flow generating the parameters of an error response. This error cannot be handled since the source has already executed the failing path. 
** `SOURCE_ERROR_RESPONSE_SEND`: indicates that an error ocurred in the source of the flow sending an error response. This error cannot be handled since the source has already executed the failing path. 
* `SOURCE_RESPONSE`: indicates that an error ocurred in the source of a flow while processing a successful response. These errors can only be propagated, since the the source has already executed the successful path. 
** `SOURCE_RESPONSE_GENERATE`: indicates an error ocurred in the source of the flow while generating the parameters of a successful response.
** `SOURCE_RESPONSE_SEND`: indicates an error ocurred in the source of the flow while sending a successful response.
* `CIRTICAL`: indicates a severe error ocurred. These errors cannot be handled. 
** `OVERLOAD`: indicates a problem of overloading ocurred and the execution was rejected. 
*** `FLOW_BACK_PRESSURE`: indicates a problem of overloading ocurred at the source level. For example, using a HTTP listener as source.  
** `FATAL_JVM_ERROR`: indicates that a fatal error ocurred, such as stack overflow. 

== About Custom Error Types

Custom error types can be defined when mapping errors or raising them. These errors
require a specific custom namespace to distinguish them from other existing types
within an application. This means that in an application using HTTP and DB, those
two namespaces cannot be used. In fact, it's best to stay away from existing connector
namespaces and instead define namespaces related to the particular Mule application name or context.

For example, a customer aggregation API could use the `CUSTOMER` namespace for it's
custom error types and an order processing API could use the `ORDER` namespace.

== About Error Mappings

In each operation of your flow, you can map the possible error types to a custom error type of your choosing. You can use these custom error types to differentiate exactly where an error occurred in your flow. For example, if your flow has two HTTP Request operations that reach out to different REST services, a connectivity failure on either produces the same error but by mapping each to different custom error types so that you can differentiate the error handling of each operation failure, as well as more quickly identify the source of the error in the Mule application logs.

In the example below, you can see how mappings allow granular error handling:

.Example: XML Configuration for Mappings
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="retrieveMatchingOrders">
  <http:request config-ref="customersConfig" path="/customer">
    <error-mapping sourceType="CONNECTIVITY" targetType="APP:CUSTOMER_API"/>
  </http:request>
  <http:request config-ref="ordersConfig" path="/order">
    <error-mapping sourceType="CONNECTIVITY" targetType="APP:ORDER_API"/>
  </http:request>
  <error-handler>
    <on-error-continue type="APP:CUSTOMER_API">
      <logger message="#['Could not retrieve customer data.']"/>
    </on-error-continue>
    <on-error-continue type="APP:ORDER_API">
      <logger message="#['Could not retrieve customer order data.']"/>
    </on-error-continue>
  </error-handler>
</flow>
