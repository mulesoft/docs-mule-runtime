Mule execution failures result in an error. When a Mule app is running, both
the Mule runtime engine and the module and connector operations configured in the app can throw errors that are represented by a Mule error object, which
is associated with a Mule event. You can handle error objects with On-Error components and find information about them in the logs.

Mule errors are grouped into <<error_types, error types>> that follow a hierarchical
order and use a naming convention that helps you identify the source of the error
and handle the error at the level you choose. You can also create custom error
types that you map to these errors. The mappings can help you further
differentiate and group errors that you need to handle in your app.

To inspect and use values of Mule errors in your error handling configurations,
you can also use <<selector_expressions, selector expressions>>.

Mule errors include expression (`EXPRESSION`) and stream-related errors
(`STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED`), while the operations can throw many different
types of errors. Examples include `HTTP:NOT_FOUND` (a 404 error) and
`HTTP:CONNECTIVITY` errors from the HTTP listener in the HTTP connector.
`DB:BAD_SYNTAX` and `DB:QUERY_EXPRESSION` are errors that the Select operation in
the Database connector can throw.

The reference documentation for modules and connectors (for example,
the xref:connectors::http/http-connector.adoc[HTTP Connector] and
xref:connectors::db/database-documentation.adoc[Database Connector]
references) lists Mule errors.

[[selector_expressions]]
== Selector Expressions for Mule Errors

Mule errors are complex data types with several fields, such as a description
and type. When logging and handling Mule errors, can select the values from any
number of the error fields.

[%header,cols=“1,5,2”]
|===
| Field | Description | Selector Expression

|Description
|A description of the problem.
|`#[error.description]`

|Detailed Description
|A description of the problem, which can be the same or more extensive than the description.
|`#[error.detailedDescription]`

|Type
|A type, used to characterize the problem and allow for routing within an error handler.
|`#[error.errorType]`

|Cause
|The underlying Java `Throwable` that resulted in the failure.
|`#[error.cause]`

|Message
|An optional Mule message about the problem.
|`#[error.errorMessage]`

|Child Errors
|An optional collection of inner errors, used by elements like Scatter-Gather to provide aggregated route errors.
|`#[error.childErrors]`
|===

[CAUTION]
In most cases, the `error.cause` selector returns a `Throwable` instance that is part of the Mule API. Do not access the error's internal structure to define error handling logic. The other selectors expose all the necessary information to handle errors. Also, serializing the `error.cause` might result in redundant information.

[[http-request-error]]
=== HTTP Request Error Example
For example, when an HTTP request fails with an `HTTP:NOT_FOUND` error (for a 404
status code), the values for each part of the Error Message are:

* `#[error.description]` returns:
+
[source,txt,linenums]
----
HTTP GET on resource 'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com:80/mybadrequest' failed: not found (404).
----
+
* `#[error.detailedDescription]` returns `HTTP GET on resource 'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com:80/mybadrequest' failed: not found (404).`
* `#[error.errorType]` returns `HTTP:NOT_FOUND`
* `#[error.cause]` returns `org.mule.extension.http.api.request.validator.ResponseValidatorTypedException`. If you print the return instance of `ResponseValidatorTypedException`, Mule prints the result of `toString`. When the error has an associated known HTTP status code (such as 404), the string representation of the `ResponseValidatorTypedException` instance is a human-readable description of the error.
* `#[error.errorMessage]` returns:
+
[source,txt,linenums]

The `errorMessage` element becomes available when a connector or component exposes the message that it has interpreted as an error. For example, when an HTTP request receives a status code that Mule treats
as an error, the process fails and also populates the `errorMessage` with
information about the error. You can then gain access to error message
attributes (metadata) and to the payload itself with
`&#35;[error.errorMessage.payload]` for the payload and
`&#35;[error.errorMessage.attributes]` for the metadata. In the case of an HTTP
request that returns an error, you can then use
`&#35;[error.errorMessage.attributes.statusCode]` to select the value of the
status code (such as `404`). To see message attributes in Studio, see
xref:studio::datasense-concept.adoc[DataSense].
+
* `&#35;[error.childErrors]` returns: `[]`

[[error_types]]
== Mule Error Types

Mule errors have a namespace (such as `HTTP:` and `FILE:`) and identifier
(such as `NOT_FOUND`), and they belong to a hierarchy of error types.

The naming convention enables you to
distinguish errors according to their domain. For example, instead of
throwing `NOT_FOUND`, the HTTP connector can throw `HTTP:NOT_FOUND`, and the
File connector can throw `FILE:NOT_FOUND` errors.

Unlike connectors, Mule runtime errors have an implicit `MULE` namespace, so
`MULE:EXPRESSION` and `EXPRESSION` are interpreted the same way.

Error types can have a parent
type. For example, the parent of `HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED` is `MULE:CLIENT_SECURITY`,
and the parent of `MULE:CLIENT_SECURITY` is `MULE:SECURITY`. This hierarchy
implies that each error type is a specification of more global error type.
For example, an `HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED` error type is a type of client security
error (`MULE:CLIENT_SECURITY`), which is a type of a more broad security issue
(`MULE:SECURITY`).

The hierarchies enable you to route errors in a general or more specific way. For
example, an error handler for `MULE:SECURITY` catches `HTTP:UNAUTHORIZED` errors
and OAuth errors. The follow figure shows the core runtime hierarchy:

image::error-hierarchy.png["A hierarchy of error types showing categories including ANY and CRITICAL"]

All errors belong to one of these two main types: `ANY` or `CRITICAL`. Each type
under `ANY` is matched by its parent and can be handled, while error types under
`CRITICAL` are so severe that cannot be handled and are only logged. `CRITICAL`
errors include `FATAL_JVM_ERROR` and `OVERLOAD`.

Whenever there is no clear reason for a failure, a component can use the
`UNKNOWN` type. You handle this error through the `ANY` type to define unclear
errors, without changing the existing behavior of the app.

For connectors, each connector defines its error type hierarchy considering
the core runtime hierarchy, though `CONNECTIVITY` and `RETRY_EXHAUSTED` types
are always present because they are common to all connectors.

Error Types:

* `ANY`: error type that matches all error types that occur in a Flow and can be
handled. This type does not include errors that occur on the source.
** `TRANSFORMATION`: indicates an error occurred while transforming a value. This involves Mule Runtime internal transformations and not DataWeave transformations.
** `EXPRESSION`: indicates an error occurred while evaluating a DataWeave expression.
** `VALIDATION`: indicates a validation error occurred.
*** `DUPLICATE_MESSAGE`: indicates a validation error regarding a message being processed twice. For example, using the xref:idempotent-message-validator.adoc[Idempotent message validator].
** `REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED`: indicates that max attempts to reprocess a message from a source have been exhausted.
** `CONNECTIVITY`: indicates that there was a problem establishing a connection. This could occur while using a connector, for example, an HTTP requester.
*** `RETRY_EXHAUSTED`: indicates that retries of a certain execution block have been exhausted. For example, for a given operation, or using xref:until-successful-scope.adoc[Until Successful Scope].
** `ROUTING`: indicates an error occurred while routing a message. For example, using the xref:round-robin.adoc[Round Robin router].
*** `COMPOSITE_ROUTING`: indicates that one or more errors occurred while routing a message. For example, using a xref:scatter-gather-concept.adoc[Scatter Gather Router].
** `SECURITY`: indicates a security error occurred, like invalid credentials being received or an expired token being used.
*** `CLIENT_SECURITY`: indicates an external entity (e.g., calling an external endpoint) produced a security error.
*** `SERVER_SECURITY`: indicates a security error enforced by the Mule Runtime.
**** `NOT_PERMITTED`: indicates a security restriction enforced by a filter. For example, using xref:connectors::spring/spring-module.adoc#_to_validate_authentication_using_the_spring_authorization_filter[the Authorization Filter of the Mule Spring Module].
** `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED`: indicates the maximum size allowed for a stream has been exceeded. For more insight, see xref:streaming-about.adoc[Streaming in Mule Apps].
** `TIMEOUT`: indicates timeout occurred while processing a message.
** `UNKNOWN`: indicates an unknown or unexpected error occurred. This cannot be handled directly, only by handling `ANY`, to ensure backward compatibility in case more error types are added in future runtime versions.
* `SOURCE`: indicates that an error occurred in the source of the flow. These errors cannot be handled.
** `SOURCE_ERROR_RESPONSE_GENERATE`: indicates that an error occurred in the source of the flow generating the parameters of an error response. This error cannot be handled since the source has already executed the failing path.
** `SOURCE_ERROR_RESPONSE_SEND`: indicates that an error occurred in the source of the flow sending an error response. This error cannot be handled since the source has already executed the failing path.
* `SOURCE_RESPONSE`: indicates that an error occurred in the source of a flow while processing a successful response. These errors can only be propagated since the source has already executed the successful path. These errors cannot be handled.
** `SOURCE_RESPONSE_GENERATE`: indicates an error occurred in the source of the flow while generating the parameters of a successful response.
** `SOURCE_RESPONSE_SEND`: indicates an error occurred in the source of the flow while sending a successful response.
* `CRITICAL`: indicates a severe error occurred. These errors cannot be handled.
** `OVERLOAD`: indicates a problem of overloading occurred and the execution was rejected.
*** `FLOW_BACK_PRESSURE`: indicates a problem of overloading occurred at the source level. For example, using an HTTP listener as a source.
** `FATAL_JVM_ERROR`: indicates that a fatal error occurred, such as stack overflow.

== Custom Error Types

To use custom error types, you need to define them either when mapping or when
xref:raise-error-component-reference.adoc[raising] the errors. These errors
require a specific custom namespace to
distinguish them from other existing types within an application. This means
that an app that uses HTTP and Database connector operations cannot use the
HTTP and DB namespaces for custom error types.

You need to define namespaces that are related to the particular Mule app name
or context and avoid using existing connector namespaces. For example, a
customer aggregation API might use the `CUSTOMER` namespace for its custom
error types, and an order-processing API might use the `ORDER` namespace.

== Error Mappings

In each operation of your flow, you can map the possible error types to a
custom error type of your choosing. You can use these custom error types to
differentiate where an error occurred in your flow.
For example, if your flow has two HTTP Request operations that reach out to
different REST services, a connectivity failure on either produces the same
error. By mapping each error to different custom error types, you can
differentiate the error handling of each operation failure and quickly identify
the source of the error in the Mule app logs.

In the following example, you can see how mappings allow granular error handling
by defining two custom error types: `APP:CUSTOMER_API` and `APP:ORDER_API`.

Example XML Configuration for Mappings:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="retrieveMatchingOrders">
  <http:request config-ref="customersConfig" path="/customer">
    <error-mapping sourceType="CONNECTIVITY" targetType="APP:CUSTOMER_API"/>
  </http:request>
  <http:request config-ref="ordersConfig" path="/order">
    <error-mapping sourceType="CONNECTIVITY" targetType="APP:ORDER_API"/>
  </http:request>
  <error-handler>
    <on-error-continue type="APP:CUSTOMER_API">
      <logger message="#['Could not retrieve customer data.']"/>
    </on-error-continue>
    <on-error-continue type="APP:ORDER_API">
      <logger message="#['Could not retrieve customer order data.']"/>
    </on-error-continue>
  </error-handler>
</flow>
