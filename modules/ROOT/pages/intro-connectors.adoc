Mule runtime engine (Mule) 3 offered two ways of connecting to systems: transports and connectors. Transports used the concept of inbound and outbound endpoints to send data. Connectors used the concept of operations to invoke systems, for example, `<http:request>` or `<db:select>`.

In Mule 3, MuleSoft replaced some of these transports with new HTTP and Database connectors. Mule runtime engine (Mule) 4 completes this change: all connectivity is built as connectors. This change improves the consistency and usability of connectors, and it enables more powerful connectors.

== Independent Release Cycles for Core Connectors and Modules

Another big difference is how the connectors are shipped and released. In Mule 3, a number of connectors/transports were part of the Mule Runtime distribution (for example, File, Ftp, Sftp, HTTP, Database, JMS, XML, Validations, and so on). To get fixes and enhancements to any of these connectors, it was necessary to wait for the next Mule Runtime release. Meanwhile, other connectors (typically the SaaS connectors) were shipped and released independently (for example, Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, SAP, and so on).

Mule 4 standardizes the latest model. The Mule 4 distribution ships with no connectors or modules. Instead, each application includes the modules it needs. This approach has the following advantages:

* All connectors have their own release cycle, supporting faster innovation. New features and bug fixes are available without the need to wait for the next Mule release.
* Different apps use different versions of the same module. This allows for easier adoption of new releases without the need to run a full regression on applications that don't require the upgrade.
* The consistent approach makes learning new connectors easier.
