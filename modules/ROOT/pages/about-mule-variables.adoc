= Variables in Mule Apps

Variables are used to store per-event values for use within a flow of a Mule app. The stored data can be any supported data type, such as an object, number, or string. It is also possible to store the current message (using the `message` keyword), the current message payload (using the `payload` keyword) or just the current message attributes (using the `attributes` keyword). You can even use a DataWeave expression as the value. However, the keyword `vars` (for example, `vars.someOtherVar`) is not allowed.

You can create, or update, variables in these ways:

* Using the Set Variable component.
* Using a Target Variable from within an operation, such as the Read operation to the File connector or the Store operation to the Database connector.
* Using the Datwave Transform Component (EE-Only)
* Using Scripting Component (in scripting module)

You can also delete/remove:

* Using the Remove Variable component.

After creating a variable, you can access and use it within the scope of a Mule flow where you created it, which includes any flows that are joined with it through a Flow Ref component.

* `vars`: Keyword for accessing a variable, for example, through a DataWeave expression in a Mule component, such as the Logger, or from an Input or Output parameter of an operation. If the name of your variable is `myVar`, you can access it like this: `vars.myVar`

Note that a variable in the Mule event is different from variables defined in a DataWeave script, which are local to the script and not accessible outside of it.
