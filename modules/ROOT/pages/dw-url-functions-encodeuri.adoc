[[encodeuri1]]
== encodeURI(String): String

The encodeURI() function encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) by replacing each instance of certain characters by
one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character
(will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).

Assumes that the URI is a complete URI, so does not encode reserved characters that have special meaning in the URI.

encodeURI replaces all characters except the following with the appropriate UTF-8 escape sequences:

[%header%autowidth.spread]

| Type                 | Includes
| Reserved characters  | ; , / ? : @ & = $
| Unescaped characters | alphabetic, decimal digits, - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )
| Number sign          | #
