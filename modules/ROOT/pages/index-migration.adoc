Mule 4 improvements make it easier to learn, develop, and manage than Mule 3. For an overview of these capabilities, you should read xref:mule-runtime-updates.adoc[What's New in Mule 4].

This documentation describes the differences between Mule 3 and Mule 4, indicates when you should migrate to Mule 4, and shows what it takes to migrate apps manually. It includes information on these topics:

* xref:intro-overview.adoc[Introduction to Mule 4]: An overview of Mule 4 for those who already know Mule 3.
* xref:migration-prep.adoc[Preparing for a Migration]: Steps to think about before migrating a Mule app.
* xref:migration-process.adoc[About the Migration Process]: An overview of the major steps involved in a migration.
* xref:migration-cheat-sheet.adoc[Migration Cheat Sheet]: A quick index pointing to relevant articles about the most common migration tasks.
* More in-depth migration details:

IMPORTANT: MuleSoft will be releasing a tool to help automatically update applications to Mule 4 soon. Unless there is some urgent need to migrate now, we recommend that for now only use Mule 4 for new projects and only use this guide as a learning tool for existing Mule 3 users.

This guide should apply to all 3.x versions. However, the 3.x examples use Mule 3.9.
