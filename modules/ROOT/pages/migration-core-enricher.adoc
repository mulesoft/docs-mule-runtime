// Explain generally how and why things changed between Mule 3 and Mule 4.
The Message Enricher in Mule runtime engine (Mule) 3 is replaced by the `target` parameter in Mule 4. The Enricher provided a way to execute a group of message processors and redirect their output to a variable without side effects to the current message. In Mule 4, all non-void operations such as `<flow-ref>`, `<http:request>`, `<ftp:write>`, and `<db:select>` include `target` and `targetValue` parameters, which allow redirecting each operation's output into a variable (such as `myVar`). Other components in a Mule flow can then access that data through a DataWeave selector (for example, `vars.myVar`).

Consider a message coming from an HTTP request, which we want to redirect to a third system, adding a `state` query parameter which is to be extracted using a secondary flow called `stateLookup`. Because you don't want to lose the original payload or headers, you need to extract this value without affecting the original message. The Enricher calls out to the enrichment resource with the current message (containing the zip code), then enriches the current message with the result.

.Mule 3 example
----
<flow name="orderProcessingFlow">
   <http:listener .../>
   <enricher target="#[variable:state]">
       <flow-ref name="stateLookup"/>
   </enricher>
  <http:request config-ref="config" path="state" method="POST">
    <http:request-builder>
        <http:query-param paramName="state" value="#[flowVars.state]" />
    </http:request-builder>
  </http:request>
</flow>
----

In Mule 4, you can simply use the `target` parameter in the `<flow-ref>` operation:

.Mule 4 example
----
<flow name="orderProcessingFlow">
  <http:listener .../>
  <flow-ref name="stateLookup" target="state" />
  <http:request config-ref="config" path="state" method="POST">
    <http:query-params>
      #[{'state' : vars.state}]
    </http:query-params>
  </http:request>
</flow>
