This section describes the reconnection strategies you can configure by editing your Mule application's XML configuration file.

== Reconnect

A reconnection strategy that allows the user to configure how many times a reconnection should be attempted and how long to wait between attempts.

=== Attributes of reconnect

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|`blocking` |boolean |no |true |If false, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread
|`frequency` |long |no |2000 |How often (in ms) to reconnect
|`count` |integer |no |2 |How many reconnection attempts to make
|===

=== Child Elements of reconnect

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|`abstract-reconnect-notifier` |0..1 |A placeholder for a reconnection notifier element. The RetryNotifier interface is a callback that allows actions to be performed after each reconnection attempt, for example, firing server notification events on success or failure.
|===

For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:activemq-connector name="AMQConnector">
    <reconnect count="5" frequency="1000"/>
</jms:activemq-connector>
----

== Reconnect Forever

A reconnection strategy that retries an infinite number of times at the specified frequency.

=== Attributes of reconnect-forever

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|`blocking` |boolean |no |true |If false, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread.
|`frequency` |long |no |2000 |How often (in ms) to reconnect.
|===

== Reconnect Custom Strategy

A user-defined reconnection strategy.

=== Attributes of <reconnect-custom-strategy...>

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description |
|`blocking` |boolean |no |true |If false, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread.
|`class` |class name |yes |
|===

A class that implements the `RetryPolicyTemplate` interface.

=== Child Elements of reconnect-custom-strategy

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|`abstract-reconnect-notifier` |0..1 |A placeholder for a reconnection notifier element. The RetryNotifier interface is a callback that allows actions to be performed after each reconnection attempt, for example, firing server notification events on success or failure.
|`spring:property` |0..* |
|===

For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:activemq-connector name="AMQConnector">
    <reconnect-custom-strategy class="org.mule.retry.test.TestRetryPolicyTemplate">
        <spring:property name="fooBar" value="true"/>
        <spring:property name="revolutions" value="500"/>
    </reconnect-custom-strategy>
</jms:activemq-connector>
