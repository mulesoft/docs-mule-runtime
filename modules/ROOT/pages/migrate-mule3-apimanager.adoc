= Migrate Applications Managed by API Manager
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

You migrate your existing Mule 3 applications that are managed by API Manager to Mule 4 using the following steps: 

. <<prepare-migration,Prepare for your migration>>
+
Based on how your existing Mule 3 application is configured, carefully review the prerequisites to prepare for the migration.
. <<determine-migration-approach,Determine the migration approach>>
+
Based on several factors, such as whether the migration requires a downtime, requires removing applied policies, or requires migrating contracts, you use an existing API instance or create an instance for the migration.
. <<perform-migration,Perform the migration>>
+
Migrate your application using an existing or a new API.


[[prepare-migration]]
== Prepare to Migrate Your Mule 3 Applications

Before you migrate your existing Mule 3 applications managed by API Manager to Mule 4, carefully review the following guidelines and determine:

*  How your Mule 3 application is managed--is it a basic endpoint, integration application or, a complex proxy.
+
To migrate your application in this scenario, first xref:mule-runtime::migration-api-gateways.adoc[review how to migrate API gateways]
to prepare, and then xref:mule-runtime::migration-intro.adoc[migrate to Mule 4].
* How your application is secured--does it have default or custom policies applied.
+
If you applied custom policies to your Mule 3 API, follow xref:mule-runtime::migration-api-gateways-policies.adoc[Migrating API Policies]. If you have applied an out-of-the-box proxy, you can recreate the proxy by using the API Manager UI.
* If you have not classified your API, first xref:api-manager::classify-api-task.adoc[classify an API Instance into an Environment].


[[determine-migration-approach]]
== Determine the Migration Approach

You migrate your Mule 3 application managed by API Manager either by using an existing API instance or by creating an instance. Before you decide the option to use, carefully consider the following migration factors to determine the approach that best suits your requirements:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a"]
|===
| Migration Factor | Use Existing API Instance | Create API Instance
| Requires downtime  | Yes | No 
| Requires removing applied policies | Yes | No
| Requires migrating contracts | No | Yes
| Provides API metrics continuity on API Instance | Yes | No
|===


[[perform-migration]]
== Perform the Migration

You can migrate your Mule 3 application using:

* <<migrate-with-existing-api,An Existing API Instance>>
* <<migrate-with-new-api,A New API Instance>>


[[migrate-with-existing-api]]
=== Migrate Using an Existing API Instance

*Task Prerequisite*

Before you use the existing API Instance to migrate your Mule 3 application, determine whether your API raises security issues if policies are inactive:

* API with no security concerns
+
This scenario is for APIs that allow a small window of time in which their policies can be removed. For example, an API that has the Rate Limiting SLA-based policy applied may not be critical for business operations. If your API can support inactive policies for a short period of time,   
skip <<step1,step 1>> of the following procedure. 
* API with security concerns
+ 
This scenario is for APIs that need to have their policies active at all times for security reasons. For example, APIs that use API Manager to apply authentication policies are very critical for daily business operations. If your API cannot support inactive policies even for a short period of time, perform <<step1,step 1>> of the following procedure. 

To migrate your Mule 3 API to Mule 4 using an existing API instance: 
[[step1]]
. If your API has security concerns, stop your Mule 3 application. Otherwise, skip to the next step in this procedure.
+
To stop your application, go to the `$MULE_HOME/apps` folder and delete the anchor file for the application or stop the Mule instance that is running the application.
. From the *API Administration* page in *API Manager*, select the existing API instance and click *Policies*.
. For every policy applied to the API, expand the policy that you want to remove, and select *Actions* > *Remove*. 
+ 
Note that attempting to change the Mule version of your API before you remove the policies results in the `Cannot change endpoint configuration regarding if the API is going to be managed or not in Mule 4 or above. There are policies applied to the API` error.
. Go to the API Settings page of the API and update the Mule version:
+
image:mule-version-migrate-mule3.png[80%,90%]
. If the policies you removed in the previous step were not automated, reapply those policies to the API instance.
. Based on whether you application is an integration application or an out-of-the-box proxy, perform one of the following steps:
** If your application is an integration application, start the Mule 4 instance that contains the migrated application. If your Mule 3 instance is still running, turn it off.
** If your application is an out-of-the-box proxy, download the new proxy and place it on your Mule 4 instance. 
+
Alternatively, redeploy the proxy to your CloudHub or Runtime Fabric runtime instance. If your Mule 3 instance is still running, turn it off.
. After successfully validating your application, undeploy your Mule 3 application.


[[migrate-with-new-api]]
=== Migrate Using a New API Instance

Use the high-level proposal illustrated in the following diagram to use a new API instance for configuring an independent Mule runtime instance on Mule 4:

image:new-instance-migration-mule4.png[]

If your Mule application is not a proxy, this same proposal applies to your migration procedure, without the backend component.

To migrate your Mule 3 API to Mule 4 using a new API instance: 

. From the *API Administration* page in API Manager, select *Manage API* > *Create new API*. 
+
Use an instance label to identify this new API instance. 
. On the *Endpoint Configuration* window, select `Mule 4` in *Mule version* and save.
. From the left navigation pane in API Manager, apply alerts, SLA tiers, and policies to your API.
. If your API uses contract-based policies, for example Client ID Enforcement policy, <<migrate-contracts,migrate the contracts>> of the API instance. 
. If you completed configuring your API, start your Mule 4 application and try sending it requests. 
. After successfully validating your application, undeploy your Mule 3 application.


[[migrate-contracts]]
=== Migrate Contracts

If you are migrating your application using the new API instance approach, you must migrate the API contracts to your new Mule 4 environment. 

*Task Prerequisite*

Before you migrate your contracts, ensure that you have the following roles:

* Organization Administrator of the master organization
* Application Owner of every application that has a contract with the source API

To migrate contracts using the Anypoint Platform UI:

.. Go to *API Manager* > *Client Applications* and select the application.
+
Ensure that the `API` option is selected in the *Contracts* field.
.. On the right navigation, scroll down to the *Owners* field and add your name.
.. From *Exchange*, select your API instance and request access. 
.. From *API Manager*, grant yourself the access. 


To automate the request approval process:

. Add owners for the application:
+

curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/repository/v2/organizations/<MASTER_ORG_ID>/applications/<CLIENT_APP_ID>/owners' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>' \
  --data-raw '{"id":"<YOUR_USER_ID"}' 
----
. Request access to the API instance:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/api/v2/organizations/<ORG_ID>/applications/<CLIENT_APP_ID>/contracts' \
  -H 'authorization: bearer <TOKEN>' \

  --data-raw '{"apiId":"<API_INSTANCE_ID>","environmentId":"<ENVIRONMENT_ID>","instanceType":"api","acceptedTerms":true,"organizationId":"<ORG_ID>","groupId":"<GROUP_ID>","assetId":"<ASSET_ID>","version":"<ASSET_VERSION>","versionGroup":"<VERSION_GROUP>"}'
----
. Approve contracts:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
curl 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apimanager/xapi/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/environments/<ENV_ID>/apis/<API_ID>/contracts/<CONTRACT_ID>/approve' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
  --data-raw '{}' 
----


== Migrating to the Latest Mule 3 Version

If you are not ready to migrate to Mule 4 and you need to migrate to the latest version of Mule 3, see xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/updating-mule-versions.adoc[Upgrading Mule Runtime Engine(Versions 3.x to 3.n).

Carefully review the release notes for the Mule version to which you are migrating. When you start the new Mule runtime with the same application pointing to the same API instance, your existent API is instantly managed with the latest Mule 3.x version. You do not need to perform any additional steps in API Manager.
