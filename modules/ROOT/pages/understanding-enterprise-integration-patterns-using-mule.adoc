Enterprise Integration Patterns are accepted solutions to recurring problems within a given context. The patterns provide a framework for designing, building messaging and integration systems, as well as a common language for teams to use when architecting solutions.

Mule supports most of these patterns shown in the Enterprise Integration Patterns book written by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf.

By implementing these patterns, Mule reduces the effort required when building integrations. You can use these well-known patters to design your solution and then simply configure and use these same patters in Mule.


== Mapping Enterprise Integration Patterns into Mule Objects

There is a list of patterns that can be mapped directly with Mule objects. Review the following list of Enterprise Integration Patterns mapped to Mule objects:

=== Integration Styles

|Pattern |Mapping to a Mule Object
|File Transfer |xref:connectors::file/file-connector.adoc[File Connector]
|Shared Database |xref:connectors::db/db-connector-index.adoc[DataBase Connector]
|Remote Procedure Invocation | Mule APIs are meant to work like this (or even doing requests to external APIs).
|Messaging |Mule is all about Messaging.

=== Messaging Systems

[%header,cols="2*"]
