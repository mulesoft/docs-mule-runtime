Enterprise Integration Patterns are accepted solutions to recurring problems within a given context. The patterns provide a framework for designing, building messaging and integration systems, as well as a common language for teams to use when architecting solutions.

Mule supports most of the patterns shown in the Enterprise Integration Patterns book written by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf.

Mule reduces the effort required when building integrations by implementing the patterns that you use to design solutions. You can then simply configure and use these same patterns in Mule.


== Mapping Enterprise Integration Patterns into Mule Objects

Review the following list of Enterprise Integration Patterns that can be mapped directly to Mule objects:
