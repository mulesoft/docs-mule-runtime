== Installing Connectors

Beyond those included with the out-of-the-box version of Mule Studio, there are many more **Anypoint Connectors** you can download and use in your Mule applications to connect to third-party APIs. If you want to add to your catalog of Mule Studio connectors, you can download many more from the *MuleStudio Connectors Update Site*. If you don't use Mule Studio, you can install the appropriate Maven dependencies into your `pom.xml` file.

=== Maven

To uninstall a connector, remove the Maven dependency for that connector from your `pom.xml` file.

== Dependencies

[discrete.view]
=== Mule Studio

When you add a connector to your flow, Studio automatically adds all of its dependencies (including `.jar` files) to your project's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classpath_(Java)[classpath]. Mule manages each connector's dependencies as an Eclipse user library. Because Studio adds a connector's dependencies to your project's classpath, you can reference connector classes within other projects in your Mule Studio instance.

==== Manually Adding Connector Dependencies

Complete the following procedure to manually add connector dependencies to your project's classpath in Studio.

. In the *Package Explorer* pane, right-click on your project's name, then select *Build Path* > *Add Libraries*.
. In the *Add Libraries* wizard, select **Mule Cloud Connector Dependencies,** then click *Next*.
+

. Check the boxes associated with the connector dependencies you wish to add to your project's classpath.
+

. Click *Finish* to add the dependencies.

=== Maven

If you are installing a connector as a Maven dependency, ensure that you complete the following three steps for each connector:

. To make any connector module available to a Mavenized Mule application, first add the following repositories to your `pom.xml` file:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>mulesoft-releases</id>
        <name>MuleSoft Repository</name>
        <url>https://repository.mulesoft.org/releases/</url>
        <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
    <repository>
        <id>mulesoft-snapshots</id>
        <name>MuleSoft Snapshot Repository</name>
        <url>https://repository.mulesoft.org/snapshots/</url>
        <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----

. Then add the module as a dependency to your project, replacing `insert-artifactId-here` with the artifactId of the specific module you are adding and replacing RELEASE with the version of this module.
+

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
    <artifactId>insert-artifactId-here</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

. If you plan to use this module inside a Mule application, you need to add it to the packaging process. As such, the final zip file which will contain your flows and Java code will also contain this module and its dependencies. Add a special inclusion to the configuration of the Mule-Maven plugin for this module, replacing `insert-artifactId-here` with the artifactId of the specific module you are adding.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.mule.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-mule-plugin</artifactId>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <excludeMuleDependencies>false</excludeMuleDependencies>
        <inclusions>
            <inclusion>
                <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
                <artifactId>insert-artifactId-here</artifactId>
            </inclusion>
        </inclusions>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
