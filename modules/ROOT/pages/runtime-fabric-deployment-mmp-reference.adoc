| muleVersion | The Mule runtime version that will run in your Runtime Fabric instance. +
You need to ensure that this value is at equal or higher than the minimum required runtime version of your application.
| username | Your Anypoint Platform username.

  <key>value</key> +
</properties>


For example:

<properties> +
  <http.port>8081</http.port> +
</properties>

By default, it is set to 1.
