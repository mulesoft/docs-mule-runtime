|Parameter | Description
|runtimeFabricDeployment | Top Level Element.
| uri | Your Anypoint Platform URI. +
If not set, by default this value is set to +https://anypoint.mulesoft.com+.
| muleVersion | The Mule runtime version that will run in your Runtime Fabric instance. +
You need to ensure that this value is at equal or higher than the minimum required runtime version of your application.
| username | Your Anypoint Platform username.
| password | Your Anypoint Platform password.
| applicationName | The name of your application deployed in Exchange. +
This name is part of the domain of your deployed app.
|skip | Boolean value. When set to true, skips the plugin deployment goal. Its default value is false.
| target | The Runtime Fabric target name where to deploy the app.
| provider | Provider type. Possible values are: MC, SERVER, CLUSTER, SERVER_GROUP.
| environment | The Anypoint Platform environment to which you want to deploy.
| properties | Top level element. +
If you need to set properties for your Mule application being deployed, you can use the <properties> top level element:

<properties> +
  <key>value</key> +
</properties>


For example:

<properties> +
  <http.port>8081</http.port> +
</properties>
| replicationFactor | The number of instances for your application. +
By default, it is set to 1.
| publicUrl | Url of the deployed application.
| lastMileSecurity | Enable Last-Mile security to forward HTTPS connections to be decrypted by this application. +
This requires an SSL certificate to be included in the Mule application, and also requires more CPU resources. +
By default, is set to false.
| clusteringEnabled | Enable Mule clustering across each replica of the application. It requires to have at least two replicas. +
By default, is set to false. +
| memoryReserved | Amount of memory to be allocated for each replica of the application. If not present, the default value is 700MB. +

For example:

<deploymentSettings> +
    <memoryReserved>100Mi</memoryReserved> +
</deploymentSettings> +

This will set 100MB of memory to each replica.

| memoryMax| Amount of max memory to be allocated for each replica of the application. If memoryReserved configuration is present, ensure that this value is equal or higher. +

For example:

<deploymentSettings> +
    <memoryMax>200Mi</memoryMax> +
</deploymentSettings> +

This will set 200MB of memory max to each replica.


| cpuReserved | Amount of cores to be allocated for each replica of the application. If not present, the default value is 0.5 vCores. +

For example:

<deploymentSettings> +
    <cpuReserved>500m</cpuReserved> +
</deploymentSettings> +

This will set 0.5 vCores to each replica.
| cpuMax | Amount of max cores to be allocated for each replica of the application. If cpuReserved configuration is present, ensure that this value is equal or higher.

For example:

<deploymentSettings> +
    <cpuMax>1000m</cpuMax> +
</deploymentSettings> +

This will set a max of 1 vCores to each replica.
| server | Maven server with Anypoint Platform credentials. This is only needed if you want to use your credentials stored in your Maven `settings.xml` file. This is not the Mule server name.
