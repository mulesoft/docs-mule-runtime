== Introduction

The FTP transport allows integration of the File Transfer Protocol into Mule. Mule can poll a remote FTP server directory, retrieve files and process them as Mule messages. Messages can also be uploaded as files to a directory on a remote FTP server.

Mule also supports the SFTP protocol for secure file transfer. As of Mule 3, the [SFTP Transport] is included in the Mule distribution.

== Namespace and Syntax

Namespace (Community Edition):

----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftp
----

XML Schema location (Community Edition)

----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ftp/3.2/mule-ftp.xsd
----

Namespace (Enterprise Edition)

----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/ftp
----

XML schema location (Enterprise Edition)

----
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/ee/ftp/3.2/mule-ftp-ee.xsd
----

Syntax

Straight URI example: ftp://theUser:secret@theHost:port/path

XML version `<ftp:endpoint host="theHost" port="22" path="/path" user="theUser" password="secret"/>`


[TIP]
*Escape Your Credentials*
 +
If you use a URI-style endpoint and you include the user name and password, escape any characters that are illegal for URIs. Only alphabet, numeric, "-", "_", "." and "+" are allowed. For example, if the user name is `user@myco.com`, you should enter it as `user%40myco.com`.

Connector and endpoint syntax `<ftp:connector name="ftpConnector" passive="true" binary="true" streaming="true"/>`

== Considerations

=== Features

* Poll a directory on a remote FTP server for new files
* Retrieve files an FTP server
* Transfer binary or text files
* Filter files at the endpoint based on filename wildcards
* Filter files at the endpoint based on Mule expressions
* Upload and store files on an FTP server
* Rename output files based on Mule expressions
* Streaming for transferring large files
* Support for xref:configuring-reconnection-strategies.adoc[reconnection strategies]

The Mule Enterprise Edition includes several additional features that allow to to filter files to be processed by file age and moving and renaming files on the source FTP server after processing.

== Usage

Each endpoint carries all the information for the FTP connection, that is, host, port, path, username and password at least. Additional properties (like binary or passive) can be specified on the connector and overridden at the endpoint level.

The FTP transport periodically polls the FTP server. Upon each poll request, a new connection to the FTP server is opened, the specified user is logged in and all files are listed under the specified path. This means that if the FTP server goes down no special provisions need to be made - the current poll attempt fails but polling doesn't stop.

If xref:configuring-reconnection-strategies.adoc[reconnection strategies] are configured, the FTP connection can be re-established automatically by Mule based on the policy you have configured.

The FTP transport does not support transactions as the File Transfer Protocol itself is not transactional. Instead you should design compensating transactions into your architecture using exception strategies in Mule.

=====

This example shows how to pick only certain files on the FTP server. You do this by configuring filename filters to control which files the endpoint receives. The filters are expressed in a comma-separated list. Note that in order to use a filter from the file transport's schema it must be included.

----
|===

This example uses a `simple-service` to route files retrieved from the FTP server to `MyProcessingComponent` for further processing.

== Configuration Options

=== Streaming

If streaming is not enabled on the FTP connector, Mule attempts to read a file it picks up from the FTP server into a `byte[]` to be used as the payload of the `MuleMessage`. This behavior can cause trouble if large files need to be processed.

In this case, enable streaming on the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<ftp:connector name="ftpConnector" streaming="true">
----

Instead of reading the file's content into memory Mule now sends an http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html[InputStream] as the payload of the MuleMessage. The name of the file that this input stream represents is stored as the
_originalFilename_ property on the message. If streaming is used on inbound endpoints it is the responsibility of the user to close the input stream. If streaming is used on outbound endpoints Mule closes the stream automatically.

== Configuration Reference

=== FTP Transport

The FTP transport provides connectivity to FTP servers to allow files to be read and written as messages in Mule.

=== Connector

The FTP connector is used to configure the default behavior for FTP endpoints that reference the connector. If there is only one FTP connector configured, all FTP endpoints will use that connector.

.Attributes of <connector...>
[%header,cols="20,10,10,10,50"]

== Extending this Module or Transport

=== Custom FtpConnectionFactory

The `FtpConnectionFactory` establishes Mule's connection to the FTP server. The default connection factory should be sufficient in 99% of the cases. If you need to change the way Mule connects to your FTP server use the `connectionFactoryClass` attribute on the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<ftp:connector name="ftpConnector" connectionFactoryClass="com.mycompany.mule.MyFtpConnectionFactory"/>
----

Use the fully qualified class name of your `FtpConnectionFactory` subclass. Note that this *must* be a subclass of `FtpConnectionFactory` as the `FtpConnector` attempts to cast the factory to that class.

=== Filename parser

The `filenameParser` is used when writing files to the FTP server. The parser converts the output pattern configured on an endpoint to the name of the file that is written using the parser and the current message.

The filename parser used in the FTP transport should be sufficient in 99% of the cases. It is an instance of link:/docs/site/current/apidocs/org/mule/transport/file/ExpressionFilenameParser.html[ExpressionFilenameParser] which allows to use xref:expressions-configuration-reference.adoc[arbitrary expressions] to compose the filename that is used when storing files on the FTP server.

It is possible to configure a custom filename parser as a child element of the connector declaration:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ftp:connector name="ftpConnector" passive="true" binary="true" streaming="true">
    <file:custom-filename-parser class="com.mycompany.mule.MyFilenameParser"/>
</ftp:connector>
----

[NOTE]
The class you configure here must implement the link:/docs/site/current/apidocs/org/mule/transport/file/FilenameParser.html[FilenameParser] interface.

== Best Practices

Put your login credentials in a properties file, not hard-coded in the configuration. This also allows you to use different settings between development, test and production systems.
