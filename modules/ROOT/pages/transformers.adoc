== Overview

A Transformer prepares a message to be processed through a Mule flow by enhancing or altering the message header or message payload. For example, if the message source that triggers your flow receives data in XML format, but a downstream message processor requires JSON-formatted data, one or more transformers positioned between the message source and the message processor can achieve the necessary translation. (Since no XML-to-JSON transformer exists, this particular example calls for a XML-to-Object transformer chained to an Object-to-JSON transformer.)

Mule Studio provides a set of standard transformers to handle the most common data transformation scenarios. Typically, these pre-packaged building blocks require minimal configuration. However, if your particular use case requires special settings, you can open the Properties pane for the particular transformer have selected, then modify the default configuration using the drop-down lists or text-entry fields.

=== Chaining Transformers

You can sequence transformers so that the output from the first becomes the input for the next. For example, if you need to implement an A-to-D transformation, but no such pre-packaged transformer exists, you may be able to find all the pre-packaged transformers necessary to implement the chain A-to-B, B-to-C, and C-to-D, which effectively and efficiently simulates the unavailable A-to-D transformer.

=== Custom Transformers

Studio provides a *Custom Transformer*, which you can configure if no pre-packaged transformer or sequence of transformers meets your needs. This option requires you to code a Java class that performs the exact transformation you require. You then set up the Custom Transformer to reference this custom class.

=== Data Mapping

The *Anypoint* *DataMapper* transformer provides a powerful and versatile alternative to many of the standard transformers bundled with Studio. In addition to translating data from one format to another and manipulating payload values, DataMapper can map an input field (such as `last_name`) to a different output field (such as `family_name`). Multiple fields (such as `title`, `first_name`, and `last_name` can combine to form a composite field (such as `full_name`). DataMapper supports expressions that facilitate conditional value recalculation and also powerful database queries. It can also retrieve session state information to facilitate conditional message routing. For details, see https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/6/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[DataMapper User Guide and Reference].

== Common Transformer Configuration Fields

Most transformers share a set of common configuration fields, although these fields may be distributed in different ways across the *General*, *Advanced*, and *Documentation* tabs of the Properties pane. The following table describes each of these common fields:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Display Name |Defaults to the generic transformer name. Change the display name, which must be alpha-numeric, to reflect the transformer's specific role, i.e. "Appends time stamp ID"
|Return Class |Specify the Java class that generates the transformer output. This value is referenced when selecting transformers automatically or checking that the transformer has returned the proper type of output. +
 *Note* : To specify an array type, postfix the class name with square brackets '[]', as in 'org.mule.tck.testmodels.fruit.Orange[]'.
|Ignore Bad Input |Check this box to specify whether a transformer should pass a message it has not been able to process on to the next transformer in the transformer chain. If the box is left unchecked, the transformer will retain the result generated up to that point without passing anything to the next transformer in the chain.
|Encoding |Specify from the drop-down list the type of string encoding (such as `UTF-8` or `US ASCII`, etc.) used for output.
|Mime |Specify from the drop-down list the MIME type used for output, such as `text/plain` or `application/json`.
|Description |Enter a detailed description of this transformer for display in a yellow help balloon that pops up when you hover your mouse over the endpoint icon.

== Transformers Available in Studio

The transformers provided on the Studio Palette fall into four broad categories, as detailed by the tables below:

=== Script Transformers

This type of transformer integrates a script to perform the transformation. One transformer is provided for each of the four supported scripting languages, and a fifth, generic transformer can implement a script written in any of the four languages.

=== Java Object Transformers

=== Message and Variable Transformers

The four transformers in this group make special information available for specified periods as each message makes its way through a Mule application. In each case, these transformers do not modify the message directly; rather, each activates information that Mule uses to augment or modify the message. Some of these activated resources adhere to messages; others apply to the flow(s) through which a message travels. In any case, they offer a powerful means to enhance and refine Mule message processing output.

[TIP]
Collectively, these four *Message and Variable Transformers* replace the single *Message Properties Transformer*, which has been deprecated.

Please note the common characteristics of the Message and Variable Transformers:

* unlike most other transformers, these four transformers cannot be embedded within endpoints
* no *Global Element* (i.e. configuration template) exists for any of these transformers, so you must configure each instance separately
* none of these transformers can be referenced by other Mule building blocks, so, in effect, you cannot use a single instance multiple times within the same flow

The following table describes the individual *Message and Variable* transformers:

[%header,cols="4*"]
|===
|  |Transformer |What it Does |Documentation
|image:transformer-24x16.png[Transformer-24x16] |Attachment |In contrast to the *Message Enricher Scope* or the *Append String Transformer*, the *Attachment Transformer* does not add to the string that typically composes the main data payload. Instead, this transformer specifies an attachment to append to each message being processed through the flow. If the name or the value of the attachment is defined through an expression, the exact identity (and content) of the attachment can be calculated at run-time, with the possibility that each message will receive a different payload. Typically, this attachment is treated as a separate, secondary part of the outbound payload. |xref:attachment-transformer-reference.adoc[Attachment Transformer Reference]


|image:transformer-24x16.png[Transformer-24x16] |Property |This transformer allows you to specify a property, which is typically applied to the message header. The "life span" of such a property extends from the moment it is created until the message is passed to an outbound endpoint. |xref:property-transformer-reference.adoc[Property Transformer Reference]

|image:transformer-24x16.png[Transformer-24x16] |Variable |This transformer facilitates dynamic, run-time determination of the specified variable's value based on the content of the current message or the current state of the Mule environment. Mule can then use this value to alter the payload content or the processing steps ultimately assigned to the current message. This type of variable remains active as long as the message remains within the flow in which the variable was invoked. As soon as the message gets passed to a different flow via a transport, the variable becomes inactive. |xref:variable-transformer-reference.adoc[Variable Transformer Reference]

|image:transformer-24x16.png[Transformer-24x16] |Session Variable |This transformer resembles the Variable transformer, except the Session Variable set by this transformer persists as long as the associated message remains within the Mule application, even though the message may be processed through multiple flows. |xref:session-variable-transformer-reference.adoc[Session Variable Transformer Reference]
