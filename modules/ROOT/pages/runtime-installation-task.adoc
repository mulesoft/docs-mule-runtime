Before downloading and installing Mule, verify that you have a supported JDK installed.
This example uses https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=8[Eclipse Temurin 8^], which is recommended for Mule 4.4. 

[source,console]
----
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_352"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (Temurin)(build 1.8.0_352-b08)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (Temurin)(build 25.352-b08, mixed mode)
----

AdoptOpenJDK moved to the Eclipse Foundation and changed its name to the Eclipse Adoptium project. The name of the JDK changed to Temurin.

== Download Mule

. Download the Mule 4 binary file from the following link and unzip it:
+
https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/mule-esb-enterprise[https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/mule-esb-enterprise]
+
. Set an environment variable called `MULE_HOME` for the `mule` directory inside your extracted folder.
+
Example for version 4.4.0 in the `Downloads` directory:
+
* In Windows environments:
+
[source,console]
----
$ env:MULE_HOME="C:\Downloads\mule-enterprise-standalone-4.4.0"
----
+
* In Linux or Unix environments:
+
[source,console]
----
$ export MULE_HOME=~/Downloads/mule-enterprise-standalone-4.4.0
----

The procedure for making the `MULE_HOME` setting permanent depends on your operating system.

=== Test Your Mule Instance

After downloading Mule, test to confirm that it runs in your system without errors by executing the following commands:

* In Windows environments:
+
[source,powershell]
----
%MULE_HOME%\bin\mule.bat
----

* In Linux or Unix environments:
+
[source,console]
----
$ $MULE_HOME/bin/mule
----

These commands run Mule in foreground mode, and the startup script displays information on the terminal’s standard output. You can’t issue further commands on the terminal as long as Mule is running.

To stop Mule, press `CTRL-C` in the terminal in which the script is running.

== Install Mule

You can install Mule as a Windows service or as a Linux or Unix daemon by executing the corresponding command:

* In Windows environments:
+
[source,powershell]
----
$ $MULE_HOME\bin\mule.bat install
----

* In Linux or Unix environments:
+
[source,console]
----
$ $MULE_HOME/bin/mule install
----

== Configure Properties in the wrapper.conf File

After installing Mule as a service or as a daemon, you can modify the properties defined in the `wrapper.conf` file.

For details on what you can do with the configuration file, see https://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/properties.html.

After modifying the `wrapper.conf` file, restart your Mule instance to enable the changes.

[NOTE]
====
When you add new properties, ensure that no other properties already use the same sequence number.
Don't modify the `wrapper-additional.conf` file, as Mule automatically generates this file.
To prevent property sequences in `wrapper-additional.conf` from colliding with the ones you added, stop and start Mule instead of restarting it. This ensures that `wrapper-additional.conf` regenerates, incorporating your new properties. Alternatively, you can use `-additionalJavaProperties=numberOfExtraProperties` to have a gap between the last sequence in `wrapper.conf` and the first one in `wrapper-additional.conf` (Mule Enterprise Edition only).
====

== Configure CPU Affinity

Many operating systems provide a mechanism to bind a process to one or more central processing units (CPUs) so that the process executes only on the assigned CPUs. You can configure CPU affinity in your environment to run Mule in a nonvirtualized multicore server and comply with the number of cores included in your subscription.

=== Considerations When Using CPU Affinity

* CPUs have groups of cores that share a cache to improve thread communication and migration performance. To avoid such performance issues, check with your infrastructure team to identify which cores share this cache before setting up this feature.
* Check with your infrastructure team to ensure that no existing resource allocation policy that can interfere with your CPU affinity configuration.
* Ensure that the number of cores you plan to configure through CPU affinity does not exceed the number of cores included in your MuleSoft subscription plan.

== Remove the Mule Service or Daemon

You can remove Mule as a Windows service or as a Unix daemon by executing the corresponding command:

* In Windows environments:
+
[source,powershell]
----
$ $MULE_HOME\bin\mule.bat remove
----

* In Linux or Unix environments:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
$ $MULE_HOME/bin/mule remove
MULE_HOME is set to /Applications/mule-enterprise-standalone-4.3.0
MULE_BASE is set to /Applications/mule-enterprise-standalone-4.3.0
Detected Mac OSX:
Mule Enterprise Edition is not running.
