== MEL Auto-Complete

If you are configuring a field that supports expressions and need help with syntax, you can access MEL suggestions by one of two methods.

* place your cursor inside the brackets in a field that has **`#[]`** pre-populated for you, then press **Ctrl + Space Bar**.
* enter `#[` to open a new MEL expression and display suggestions, as shown below.

[WARNING]
Note that the autocomplete functionality described here works in the *Visual Editor only*. Although Studio's XML tab does offer some autocomplete options, the suggestions there are limited by Eclipse and are not based on DataSense or Mule Expression Language.
