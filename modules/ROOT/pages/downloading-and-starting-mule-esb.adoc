=== Mule EE Runtime + MMC

. Install  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Java SE Development Kit 7] on your host machine. Refer to
xref:hardware-and-software-requirements.adoc[Hardware and Software Requirements] for reference.
. Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path in which you installed the JDK.
. Download and unzip https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-enterprise[Mule Runtime]. See also <<runningstudioonamac,Running Studio on a Mac>> for additional Mac-related install information.
. Start Mule from the software download's `bin` folder by typing `./mule` for Mac and Linux, or `mule.bat` for Windows.
. Download and unzip the Mule Management Console (MMC) separately from the Support Portal.
. Open a command line and navigate to the freshly extracted folder.
. From the terminal, run the appropriate startup command for your operating system.
.. Windows:

== Running Studio on a Mac

If you're using Mac OS X Mountain Lion, there are two extra considerations to be mindful of when running Anypoint Studio.

Java Runtime Environment

Check to confirm that Java runtime environment 7 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app), run: java -version

The response should appear similar to the following:

[source,text,linenums]
----
java version "1.7.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_60-b19)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.60-b09, mixed mode)
----

If a Java runtime environment is not installed, the command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK  7.

*Application Execution*

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Anypoint Studio outside the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. *Note*: You must have Administrator privileges to adjust the security settings.

. On your Mac, open *System Preferences* and navigate to *Security & Privacy*.
. In the *General* tab, under "Allow applications downloaded from:" select the radio button for *Anywhere*.

== Downloading Enterprise Additions

If you are running *Anypoint Studio* with an *Enterprise runtime*, you can add additional modules to your Studio instance.
