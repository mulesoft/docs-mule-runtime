= Set Up a Caching Strategy
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

You can create a Caching Strategy from a Cache scope or from a Global Elements configuration in Anypoint Studio. Once you create a strategy, a Cache component in your flow can reference it.

. Open the Caching Strategy configuration window.
+
You can open it from the Cache component configuration tab or from the Caching Strategies option in the Global Elements tab within Studio.
+
. Provide a Name for your Caching Strategy.
. Reference an ObjectStore or create one for your Cache component to reference.
+
. Select a mechanism for generating a key used for storing events within the Caching Strategy:
+
* Default
* Key Expression: A DataWeave expression (for example, `keyGenerationExpression=â€œ#[vars.requestId]`).
+
Note that for two requests that are the same ("equal"), you need to generate the same key. Otherwise, you can get wrong results.
+
* Key Generator: Requires you to implement the `com.mulesoft.mule.runtime.cache.api.key.MuleEventKeyGenerator` interface.
+
. Perform any optional steps that you need.
+
* Select or create a Response Generator.
+
Note that this step requires that you implement the
`com.mulesoft.mule.runtime.cache.api.response.ResponseGenerator` interface.
+
* Change the Event Copy Strategy from Simple (the default, where data is immutable) to Serializable (where data is mutable).

////
REMOVED PER PABLO K:
* Select or create a Consumable Message Filter.
+
Note that this step requires that you implement the `com.mulesoft.mule.compatibility.core.api.routing.filter.Filter` interface.
