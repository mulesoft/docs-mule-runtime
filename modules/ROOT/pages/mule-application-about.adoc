You typically create Mule apps to perform system integrations. Mule apps are configured to run in Mule Runtime. A request to a Mule app triggers Mule to encode the request and data in a Mule Event, and to pass it along a single or multiple threads.

The main building blocks of Mule apps are components. Components execute business logic on the messages that flow through your apps. There are three categories of component: core components, components that are grouped into collections named _connectors_, and components that are grouped into collections named _modules_.

== Core Components

These are individual components that are part of the core of the functionality of Mule Runtime. Here is a sampling of the features that core components let you add to your apps:

* Asynchronous processing of parts of a flow or subflow
* Batch processing of messages
* Initiating subflows
* Logging
* Setting payloads
* Transforming messages with the DataWeave language
* Creating Try scopes in your flows, so that you can catch and respond to errors

For example, the Choice router is a component that dynamically routes messages through a flow according to a set of DataWeave expressions that evaluate message content. Each expression is associated with a different routing option. The effect is to add conditional processing to a flow, similar to an `if`/`then`/`else` code block in most programming languages.

== Connectors

Connectors group together components that were created to facilitate integration of MuleSoft applications with any external resource, such as third-party APIs or standard integration protocols. They enable connectivity to SaaS and on-premises applications, systems, and services.

For example, the Salesforce Connector provides components that let you use the Salesforce platform APIs to perform a large number of different operations.

== Modules

Modules group together components that were created to add flexibility to your apps by allowing you to aggregate values, compress data, use Java features, use extra features for processing JSON, and more. The features that modules offer are more at the level of traditional application coding.

For example, the XML module provides components that can process and extract data from an XML document.

== Mule Configuration File for Applications

Mule apps are defined in a xref:about-mule-configuration.adoc[Mule Configuration File]. This file is an XML document that specifies dependencies needed to run the app. In this configuration file, you can write the XML by hand.

You can also use the graphical user interfaces in Design Center or Anypoint Studio to structure and define the behavior of your Mule app. While you use either of these GUIs, the underlying XML is provided for you. +
In Studio, the XML is also available for viewing and editing.
