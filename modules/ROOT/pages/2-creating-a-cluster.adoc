After downloading the demo bundle and executing the six scripts, you can open the Mule Management Console to see Mule in action. We start by registering two Mule servers, or *nodes*, in the Mule Management Console, then we configure a cluster with two nodes.

== Registering Servers

. Browse to `+http://localhost:8585/mmc+`.
. Log in to the Management Console using the following credentials:
+
* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin`


. The Management Console displays a *Mule ESB Enterprise - Quick Start* screen click the image:error.png[] in the upper right corner to close.
. The Management Console presents the *Dashboard* tab by default, click the *Server* tab.
. Click *Add*, then select *New Server*.

. In the *Server Name* field on the *Add Server* screen, enter a unique name for the first server, such as `Server A`.
. In the *Mule Agent URL* field, do not adjust the value, `http:/localhost:7777/mmc-support`.

. Click *All* in the *Package Explorer* column left to return to the main screen of the *Server* tab, then click *Add*, then select *New Server* again.
. In the *Server Name* field on the *Add Server* screen, enter a unique name for the second server, such as `Server B`.
. In the *Mule Agent URL* field, adjust the default value to the following:
+
`http://localhost:7778/mmc-support`
+
. Click *Add* to register the second server.
. Click *All* in the *Package Explorer* column at left to return to the main screen of the *Server* tab. The Management Console displays the two newly-registered servers.

. Click *Add* to create the cluster. (Mule must restart the servers so this process may take a minute.)
. Click *All* in the *Package Explorer* column at left to return to the main screen of the *Server* tab. The Management Console displays the new clusters as one "server". You can now manage this cluster of servers as one.
