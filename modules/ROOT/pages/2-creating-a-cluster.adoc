[TIP]
You can now easily create a cluster through the Runtime Manager UI. See xref:runtime-manager::managing-servers.adoc#create-a-cluster[Creating and Managing Clusters].

After downloading the demo bundle and executing the six scripts, you can open the Mule Management Console to see Mule in action. We start by registering two Mule servers, or *nodes*, in the Mule Management Console, then we configure a cluster with two nodes.

== Registering Servers

. Open your browser, then go to +http://localhost:8585/mmc+  and login to the management console using the following credentials: +
* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin`
+

. The management console displays a *Mule ESB Enterprise - Quick Start* screen; click the red X icon image:red-x-icon.png[] in the upper-right corner to close.

. The management console presents the *Dashboard* tab by default; click the *Server* tab.

. Click *Add*, then select *New Server*.

. In the *Server Name* field on the *Add Server* screen, enter a unique name for the first server, such as `Server A`.

. In the *Mule Agent URL* field, do not adjust the default value, `http://localhost:7777/mmc-support`

. Click *Add* to register the first server. The management console displays the details of the newly-registered server.

. Click *All* in the *Package Explorer* column at left to return to the main screen of the *Server* tab, then click *Add*, then select *New Server* again.

. In the *Server Name* field on the *Add Server* screen, enter a unique name for the second server, such as `Server B`.

. In the *Mule Agent URL* field, adjust the default value to the following:
+
`http://localhost:7778/mmc-support`

. Click *Add* to register the second server.

. Click *All* in the *Package Explorer* column at left to return to the main screen of the *Server* tab. The management console displays the two newly-registered servers.

. In the *Cluster Name* field on the *Create Cluster* screen, enter a unique name for the cluster, such as `Dev Cluster`.

. Click to select both servers in the *Available Nodes* pane, then click the *>>* button to move the selections to the *Cluster Nodes* pane.

. Click *Add* to create the cluster. (Mule must restart the servers so this process may take a minute.)

. Click *All* in the *Package Explorer* column at left to return to the main screen of the *Server* tab. The management console displays the new cluster as one “server”. You can now manage this cluster of servers as one.
