A Try scope follows the structure described below.


* A single root element `<try>`

* Components that are executed under the error-handling rules defined by
the Try scope are defined as child elements of the `try` element. You can place one or many here.

* A single `<error-handler>` element holds all error handling strategies for the scope.

* In the error handler, one or several `on-error-continue` and `on-error-propagate` define the various strategies. At least one of these must be present.

* Components that are executed when a matching error occurs are defined as child elements of the `on-error` element. You can place one or many here.

<try>
  <!-- COMPONENTS TO TRY TO USE -->
  <error-handler>
    <on-error-continue>
      <!-- COMPONENTS TO USE IN CASE OF ERROR -->
    </on-error-continue>
    <on-error-propagate>
      <!-- COMPONENTS TO USE IN CASE OF ERROR -->
    </on-error-propagate>
  </error-handler>
</try>

Each error handling strategy in a Try scope (`on-error-*`) follows a condition. This condition is typically an error type (or a list of several) which must match the current error. You can also define this condition as a freely written expression, such as `error.cause.message.contains("fatal")`.

[NOTE]
Note that conditions are evaluated in order and only the first strategy to match is executed.







Below is an example that includes two error handling strategies, each executing a logger component:

<try>
  <http:request config-ref="HTTP-config" method="GET" path="/" />
  <error-handler>
    <on-error-continue enableNotifications="true" logException="true" type="CONNECTIVITY">
      <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Logger" message="Connectivity Error"/>
    </on-error-continue>
    <on-error-propagate enableNotifications="true" logException="true" doc:name="On Error Propagate" type="EXPRESSION">
      <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Logger" message="Expression error" />
    </on-error-propagate>
  </error-handler>
</try>

== Properties of Try

[%header,cols="20a,20,60a"]
|===
|Property | Default |Description
|`transactionalAction` | INDIFFERENT | Defines if what's in the scope is treated as a transaction. Possible values:

* INDIFFERENT : What's in the scope isn't treated as a transaction.

* ALWAYS_BEGIN: A new transaction is sarted every time the scope is executed.

* BEGIN_OR_JOIN: If the current processing of the flow has already begun a transaction, join it. Otherwise, begin a new one. (Only relevant when execution order may vary).

|`transactionalType` | LOCAL | Defines the type of transaction to use. Possible values:

* "LOCAL"
* "MULTI"
* "XA"
